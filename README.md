# Introduction to Large Language Models and Agents

Materials from **PUCP's 1IND40 Intro to LLMs & Agents** course,
part of the International Week 2025-1.

The course introduces **foundational concepts behind LLMs**,
including transformers, attention mechanisms, fine-tuning
techniques, and modern applications such as agents and tool use.

## Units
1. **Basic Concepts**: Probability theory, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Information Theory
2. **Language Modeling**: N-grams, embeddings, RNNs, Transformers
3. **Training and Fine-tuning**: SFT, RLHF, PEFT, Prompting (ICL, CoT)
4. **LLM Applications & Agents**: Tool use, semantic search, RAG, agents, HuggingFace ecosystem
