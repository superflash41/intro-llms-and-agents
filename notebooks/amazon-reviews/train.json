{"rating":3.0,"title":"Acts like an easel for our tablets for better viewing of movies","text":"I tried this with my boyfriend's iPad 3 (9 inch screen) and my Google Nexus 7 (7 inch screen).  We found that this was good for displaying the iPad as if it were in a picture frame and just okay for the Google Nexus 7.<br \/><br \/>We were able to strap the iPad in with or without the iPad case. With the Google Nexus 7 we could only lay the unit horizontally without being fastened in.  The best viewing angle for both devices was horizontal and not vertical.  It was not good in the vertical position for the Nexus because that tablet could not be secured with the straps.<br \/><br \/>Other than the ability to prop an iPad up for viewing movies or working in a vertical position, I found that this case was pretty much useless.  It does not shut off the iPad or Nexus 7 automatically like the iPad or Nexus 7 cases we have now.  Also, the case is a bit thick and since it swivels, it has creases where items (such as book jackets or papers) can get caught in the folds of the case when inserting or removing from a briefcase.<br \/><br \/>There were no instructions provided with the package although it was pretty easy to figure out.  Personally, we both agreed that this case is just okay. It's like having an easel for our tablets but does not offer much else.  The case also does not close snug to the tablet even with the elastic fastened."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Love the simplicity of this riser & that it unfolds; but it could be better","text":"This laptop stand has a small footprint when it folds up and I love that. It unfolds easily and holds my LG 14\" laptop fine. It will also hold a larger laptop. There is room underneath to store a keyboard or folders, etc. However, what I do not like is that the hooks that hold the computer on the stand are in the way of my wrists if I am typing using the laptop keyboard. I hold my hands\/arms toward the outer edge of either side of my computer to type and these hooks land right in the middle of my wrist. Of course, this is not a problem if using a separate keyboard.<br \/><br \/>The other issue is that the rubberized runners are just stickers they put on the bottom to keep the stand from slipping. The stand I received had the runners partially off in spots (see photo). I had to reset the \"tape.\"<br \/><br \/>The current price of $19.99 is reasonable for this.

That said, I was still impressed with the functionality and quality of the light.<br \/><br \/>It is quite compact, but surprisingly bright (it has 20 LEDs!). While there is an on\/off switch on the top of the light, the light is primarily controlled via an app. I was skeptical at first, but the app works pretty well and provides a LOT of color customization (I've included a short video showing some of the light configurations). As you can see in the video, the light responds immediately to the app and can display pretty much any color (it was hard to capture the precise colors with my iPhone camera).<br \/><br \/>There is a screw hole on the bottom of the light that you can use to put the light on a mount, but unfortunately, one was not included. There was also a small \"platform\" (?) screw included that allows the light to stand upright without a mount (it won't stand on its own otherwise). With this screw on the light, I can balance it on top of my monitor for lighting my video calls. It is stable and hasn't fallen, but I'm not sure if this is a sustainable solution for video calls.<br \/><br \/>The battery is 1000 mAh and is charged via a USB C cable that is included. I have not tested how long the battery lasts.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend the light if you already have a mount, otherwise I would skip it."}

It arrived and the first thought out of the box \"huh, PLASTIC\" says it has a plastic frame so it feels cheap. Opened it up and it is dead, needed to be charged so I waited 4 hours while it charged. Fully charged it searched for updates and downloaded for over 10 minutes. Next was quick and easy, loaded my  google\/chrome profile from my gmail sign in, and then it went black - no warning and stayed black while I tried everything to figure out why it was not turning on. Finally came back on. Then I noticed as it started to get super hot that THERE ARE NO VENTS. Well that explains the heat. On the plus side the keyboard is super. Still I am wondering if this was a bad purchase and knowing I have a short window to return it I am holding onto the boxes and packaging it came in.<br \/><br \/>Update Day 3: no more overheating, I am chalking it up to setup overload.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Judging Price vs. Performance, A Decent Kid\/Camping-Proof Camera","text":"To let you know where I am coming from on this review, I have two sons, 9 and 4. We do a lot of camping without mom, but want to share our adventures.  So far, our trips have destroyed a Canon Powershot 450 (overly hydrated while canoeing) and a Powershot 980IS (smashed into ground during a fall.)  So the idea of a waterproof, shockproof and hopefully kid-proof camera sounded perfect.<br \/><br \/>Purpose for camera: Rugged camera to take along canoeing, fishing, camping, and hiking for snapshots and quick, shareable movies.<br \/><br \/>I have never owned a camera in this class, and the one thing I am trying to keep in mind is the price point.  This is not intended to be a high-end performance device, but more a rugged snapshot camera.  I was a little suspect on 1080P on a hand held device under $175 (still am,) but the 5 MP camera is adequate for photos to email to grandparents and to show off our catches and camps to mom.<br \/><br \/>Design -<br \/><br \/>The camera is very nicely designed.  It is physically attractive and comfortable in the hand.  The winged doors lock into place well in their watertight positions and are, well kind of cool. The screen is adequate for playback and we spend a lot of time watching what we filmed over and over.  The controls are spare, but easy to understand and operate.  The four major flaws I found are; the embedded battery, lack of a flash, lack of lens cover, and no headphone jack for previewing sound.<br \/><br \/>Battery-<br \/><br \/>It is unfortunate that the design team decided to go with an internal non-removable battery.  This seems to move the device into the \"disposable\" class since it is useless once the battery dies.  I suspect that the battery can be replaced fairly easily, judging by the hex screws in the camera body, but there is a big difference between slipping a battery in and out and sending the camera out for replacement.  Also, I can make a huge argument for being able to carry a back up battery.  At least for now though, the battery seems to have a decent charge.  We have filmed and played back films for at least two hours between recharges and have never seen the battery near empty.<br \/><br \/>Performance -<br \/><br \/>Image capture: 1080p is a lot to ask from such a small sensor. For that matter, so is 720p.  So I am satisfied with the images I am getting, not great but what I would expect.  I usually shoot Canon DSLR's (except when camping with kids) so I am at times frustrated by the lack of manual controls of any kind.  Autofocus, autoexposure... with no way to change anything beyond file format and resolution.  The images and video I am getting are a little noisy and especially so in low light. Blurring from camera or subject motion is common on stills. This is where the flash option would be nice.  But in daylight, or decently lit interior shots the images are definitely passable.  Again, judging this camera on its price point and function, it really is decent.  If I want good stills, I'll go with a Canon 50D, if I want a snapshot of my kid pulling a bass into the canoe, this is perfect.<br \/><br \/>I am uploading a video with more details on picture and movie quality.<br \/><br \/>Sound: For a single source mike on the camera, it does pretty good.  Definitely picks up footsteps or breathing, so don't film while walking up hill.  Truly emphasizes if you are out of shape.  Picks up ambient sound well and in tests in a light breeze, did fine.<br \/><br \/>Interface:  I had the interface lock up on me once and I was unable to get it to power off or get out of a locked state.  I had to use the small reset button to get it to reboot and clear the freeze.  So I have thrown a very small paper clip in its case.  Without being able to pull the battery, the reset button seems to have been the only option.  Otherwise the device is very fast loading up, and the interface is intuitive and easy to use. Although occasionally when browsing I end up in fast forward or reverse when watching a movie and it takes a little to get it back to play or browse.<br \/><br \/>Summary:<br \/><br \/>All in all, I am really happy with this camera.  It is full of limitations which you should understand before purchase.  For the price, it is a decent camera and it fits our intended purpose to a Tee.  My kids love the ability to take a movie, then watch it immediately.  I like the feeling that it might survive the kids for a while.  I feel like I'm being pretty critical of the camera, and I guess I am.  But I'm giving it four stars because it does what I want it to, and after using it for a couple weeks, I really like it.  Just don't expect the world from a inexpensive camera.<br \/><br \/>Pros-<br \/>Price (under $175 is not a high end price)<br \/>Images are decent (under daylight or bright light conditions)<br \/>Kidproof<br \/>Quick to startup<br \/>Well thought-out design<br \/>Just all round cute and useful<br \/><br \/>Cons (in order of importance to me)<br \/>Internal Battery (cannot be replaced, nor can you carry a spare)<br \/>No Flash (can't stop motion blur, fill flash)<br \/>Low-light performance (weak performance, noisy video and stills)<br \/>Complete lack of manual controls<br \/>Occasional lock-ups on interface<br \/>No Head phones for reviewing movies<br \/>When switching through modes it keeps defaulting to zoomed out"}

Solidly built and traveler-friendly with a ton of compartments for every little thing one might need to stow away. While this backpack is slightly larger than your average backpack, it is comfortable to wear trekking cross campus. Also, another aspect of this bag that I love is that it stands upright. I know that sounds kinda crazy, but I find it annoying when your backpack flops over next to your desk and stuff kind of just falls out, or if you need to grab something quickly out of the bag you have to awkwardly curl your body around the side of your chair and then on the way up, smash your head against the desk. So yeah, lazy girl (points to self) loves the convenience of a bag that stands upright for easy grabbage. I plan to travel with this backpack when I fly home this Christmas instead of bringing a bulky tote bag on the plane."}

It was between this, Yamaha 473 or 573 units or Pioneer 1122. I went w\/ Harman Kardon based on reviews, price and expectations of use. I have a 7.2 system that can shake the house in the basement for sports, movies etc. Our LG 47LM8600 would be matched to the system and we realized we didn't need anything more than 5.1 for the Living Room based on setup downstairs and with our L\/R being somewhat small and open to dining\/kitchen this unit would be a good match.<br \/><br \/>1. I missed getting this at the $200 sale price, but willingly paid the $270 price to get it via prime and have the Living Room up and running for wife and family. I would expect as the 2013 receivers come out the sales price will return.<br \/><br \/>2. First set of speakers was the Polk Audio RM6750 HT speaker set. Unfortunately 2 were shot rather quickly. RMA returned to Newegg and got different speakers to match receiver from Amazon. Polk Audio PSW505 Sub (which works great with the 1700's LFE sub Hookup), BIC Center channel to match my Axiom M2 Bookshelves I brought down from the loft game system and the two additional Polk Audio RM6750 satellites for the rears.  - H\/K auto setup worked like a champ for surround sound, but for our setup I tweaked it a bit for the subwoofer. Easily done in manual mode.<br \/><br \/>3. Setup the Panasonic 3D Blu Ray via HDMI - no issues, You can even match names to HDMI inputs on back so they match the buttons on remote.<br \/><br \/>4. Setup DirecTV inputs (SAT\/Cable) - no issues worked well and we can get 5.1 sound on channels that have it encoded.<br \/><br \/>5. HDMI out to LG tv. didn't' realize doing this at first took away the TV's sound. Which is OK since receiver sounds better than plain tv. it just requires another remote to be used for the process.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fast, Reliable Performance Even When Configured for Second Home Network","text":"This triple-band LINKSYS AC3200 (EA9200) SMART WI-FI ROUTER represents another significant advancement in home networking power.  It has one standard 2.4 GHz band, and two 5 GHz bands that it can automatically \"steer\" between, to balance the traffic between your connected, in-use devices and maximize their performance.  To make use of this feature, you must set up your devices to use the 5 GHz bands (and not all wireless devices are 5 GHz-capable).<br \/><br \/>A feature that I love about this particular router, is the built-in stand that holds it in a vertical position.  This not only reduces the router's footprint, but also ensures that the router gets adequate ventilation.  (My horizontal Linksys AC1900 router got so warm, I had to place it on a ceramic tile to protect the tabletop.)<br \/><br \/>This Linksys AC3200 broadcasts signals (all bands) that are as strong as, or even stronger than, the signals broadcast by my rock-solid [[ASIN:B00F0DD0I6 Netgear Nighthawk Router]].  The signals reach every corner of my two-bedroom, two-story townhouse.  OOKLA speed tests show that I'm getting the full benefit of Comcast's high-speed cable Internet (download 68.12 Mbps, upload 12.15 Mbps in mid-morning; even faster speeds at night).  This is true despite my unusual current configuration--the Linksys router is connected to the Netgear router as a wired device, by Ethernet cable between an Ethernet port and the Linksys router's Internet port.<br \/><br \/>The unusual configuration gives me two independent home networks.  (You can have one network for yourself, and one for your spouse or kids; or one network for home and one for work.) All of my wireless devices are able to connect normally to the Linksys network, using the network and router passwords, though my wireless printers cannot be shared across the two networks.  Settings for either router can be accessed and adjusted from a computer or tablet that is connected to the router's network.<br \/><br \/>The Netgear and Linksys routers are peacefully co-existing on a small table near my coaxial cable connection for Comcast's high-speed Internet.  Neither interferes with the other, even though they are literally inches apart.<br \/><br \/>This router is extremely easy to set up.  You just connect it, and follow the prompts from the built-in software.  When you access the router to adjust the settings, you can click on \"Help\" at the top of the display, to get good, concise explanations of each the router's main features.  Cisco also has many instructive articles about home networking in general on its web site."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Watch Out for their Terms of Service","text":"The device worked well for me, but after 4 months, they shut off my Magicjack for violation of terms of service.  It took a bit of effort to find out what was violated and they claimed excessive use.  There is no support number; you have to get support online only with live chat or from their knowledge base.  There is a billing questions number and you can call that.  That's the only way to get a live person, but they only want you to call it for billing questions.<br \/><br \/>The problem is you have no idea what constitutes excessive use or when you might be exceeding their limits.  The terms of service says if your usage exceeds 20 times more than the average customer or more than 50 calls a day you have violated the terms.  The 50 calls is easy to quantify, but what about the 20 times more than the average?  The terms also say it is not limited to just this criteria, so you have no clue what other criteria they might use to decide that you have had excessive use.  There is no way to know what that is.  Instead of just suspending your service for a while, they cut you off permanently with no recourse.  You lose any remaining time you may have paid for.<br \/><br \/>If you are a light phone user, MagicJack may be okay for you, but don't expect to be on the phone for a lot of time or they may cut you off for excessive use, with no recourse, since you must agree to the terms of service.  I would never get this device again.  Read those terms of service before you agree to use this device."}

This item is perfect for carrying in a pocket, is very lightweight and is extremely user friendly.

I have the newest macbook air (about as slim as it gets) and yes it can slide into the case but you can't zip it shut (bag slightly too short) Then if you add anything to the inner pockets (such as cords!), you can't even get the laptop in the case at all.

We got this to use on our gas engine golf cart and needed something that could be heard above the engine- this did a solid job! The size is small and compact, it fits in our over-sized \u201cbig gulp\u201d cup holder we have on the cart as well. It\u2019s snug as a bug.. Comparable sizing: think of a coke can that's on steroids.. A little bit taller and stout- it\u2019s a cute, fat little thing!<br \/><br \/>Waterproof feature is such a bonus and was a must for us.. IF, using outdoors this offers peace of mind from possible weather elements causing damage. Buttons are marked with raised symbols and my one complaint would be.. these buttons are black on black and can be a bit hard to decipher- so, just take note.<br \/><br \/>For one without tech skills I had my kids set this up to my iPhone via Bluetooth.

It allows you to set up playlists and slide shows, and to easily record reminders, memoranda, or other things (e.g., grocery lists, parking locations, inspired thoughts).<br \/><br \/>If you're not fussy about sound quality (and I'm not), the built-in speakers give OK sound.  The supplied earplugs give much better sound, especially when the music player is set to deliver \"full sound\".  In addition, you can get pretty good \"room\" sound by plugging a portable external speaker system like the [[ASIN:B0054QNL38 AmazonBasics Portable Stereo System for MP3 Players]] into the earphones outlet. The built-in software includes a nice \"SafeSound\" feature that helps you set your earplug or headphones volume at a level that won't cause long-term hearing loss.<br \/><br \/>With the supplied USB cable, your desired media content can be easily transferred from a PC running WinXP-SP3 or Vista or Win7 by using the Windows Media Player or File Manager.  However, the device is actually intended to be used with the supplied \"Philips Songbird\" software.  You will need to install the Songbird software in order to update the firmware (which I was able to do successfully).  If Songbird works on your computer, it is certainly the best and easiest software manager for the Ariaz device. Unfortunately, Songbird didn't work well on my computer (my security software, NIS 2012, says that Songbird is safe but somewhat unstable).  Fortunately, the Songbird software gives you a clear option to use Windows Media Player, instead of Songbird, to manage your device.<br \/><br \/>The 8GB of memory holds quite a few albums worth of songs--certainly there is more than enough storage space for the material you might want to carry around with you (some family photos, your favorite music, an audiobook, your memos to yourself).<br \/><br \/>Because this was my first MP3 player, I encountered a steep learning curve.  The Quick Start guide told me to plug the player into a computer, but little more.  When plugged in, the device automatically began charging and installing the Songbird software.  When that was finished, Songbird offered to sync the device to my computer's music library.  However, the Songbird interface is not particularly easy for beginners to use, and because of my inexperience with music downloads, it took me a while to figure out how to transfer music.<br \/><br \/>Also, I was initially baffled by the device's menus and apparent lack of up\/down and left\/right navigation buttons.  Although the Quick Start guide includes a schematic drawing that depicts the device's physical buttons, I didn't notice the tiny dots that were representing the directional navigation buttons.  On the device itself, the surface around the central \"do it\" button is perfectly smooth--except for four tiny incised dots, that are invisible unless you hold the device at the correct angle to the light.  Until I downloaded the full user's manual from the Philips web site, I had no idea that up\/down and left\/right navigation was accomplished by pressing those incised dots. (You can feel the navigational buttons when you press them, once you know they're there.)<br \/><br \/>I would strongly recommend that anyone who purchases this sleek and delightful little device start by downloading the full user's manual.  You can find the manual in the Support section of the Philips web site by entering Ariaz model no. SA3ARA08K\/37 .  The manual tells you how to get started, and also gives lots of good tips on importing different types of files, generating playlists, and adding and deleting items from the device.<br \/><br \/>Another problem that I encountered was a complete overnight battery discharge--when I locked the device to turn it off, instead of turning the device completely off by holding down the on\/off button until the screen said \"Bye\".  When the device is completely turned off after use, it holds the battery charge as expected.<br \/><br \/>At present, Philips doesn't seem to have a case for this particular MP3 player.  A case that works for me--because I carry the device in a tote bag--is the [[ASIN:B0032EVXFW CaseCrown Double Memory Foam Compact MP3 Case]].  There is an elastic strap that holds the player on the right, and a mesh pocket that holds the short USB cable on the left.  The earplugs can then be added, loose, between the device and the mesh pocket when you zip up the case."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Pocket-Sized Telescope Delivers Bang for Your Bucks","text":"This BARONAGE MONOCULAR TELESCOPE (12X42 High Power BAK4 Prism, with Tripod and Phone Mount Adapter) delivers a lot of bang for the bucks (it costs about $30 on Amazon).  It\u2019s pocket-sized (about 6\u201d long, 4\u201d wide), provides good magnification, and comes with both a mini-tripod and a smartphone mount.<br \/><br \/>The magnification is quite good.  The little telescope is great for hand-held viewing of nearby objects of interest.  The focus wheel works smoothly, and it is positioned to be very easy to use.<br \/><br \/>You\u2019ll probably want to use a tripod for taking smartphone photos (though I took some decent photos without one).  The photos are pretty good, even if all you do is point, focus (looking at the smartphone display), and shoot.  (You won\u2019t be taking prize-winning nature photos with this monocular telescope, but the photos are fine for documenting a trip or other interesting sightings.)<br \/><br \/>In the attached photos, the tree closeup shows the tree seen in the top center of the second photo (which was taken from the same spot with the smartphone camera alone).  The tree closeup appears more sharply focused in my camera gallery than it does here on Amazon; some of the detail was dropped during Amazon's processing.<br \/><br \/>MOUNTING NOTES:  The telescope doesn\u2019t come with instructions for assembling the smartphone mount, or for attaching the telescope to the tripod (see the product page for these).  Note that the little projection on the telescope (actually a loop for attaching a lanyard) can be unscrewed to reveal a threaded hole for attaching the tripod.<br \/><br \/>Also, note that the smartphone mount uses a threaded piece (a round cap with a threaded hole) that screws onto the flat positioning bar that allows you to adjust the position of your smartphone and its camera lens. It\u2019s easy to overlook the cap\u2019s fine threads.  The round cap piece fits over the viewer end of the telescope to hold the smartphone clamped in the mount\u2019s pull-out jaws.  The mount worked fine with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and I didn\u2019t even have to take the phone out of its Otterbox Symmetry case."}

We were not ready to see so many wires and it looked like a pretty big project.  Before we knew it, winter had come and we lost our motivation to get this installed.  It took until the spring thaw to get into this project again and while it was not quick, the install turned out to not be so bad.  We ran lines for three cameras out to monitor our entry ways and the fourth for our commons area inside.  I am actually pretty happy with the outdoor night shots and we have captured lots of rabbits in the yard.  It is decent quality, perhaps not razor sharp, but pretty good.  We found a good location off our garage for the device itself which allowed up pretty open lines to run the wires, only once having to really fish it above the ceiling.  Now that it is all set, we have been happy knowing that it is running.  Decent system, but it does take a bit to get into place."}

It has what you need in capacity to carry the daily work items back\/forth from home to office.. I appreciate the smaller compartments to help stay organized.. and this has quite a few! The sleeve for computer seems a bit less then adequate in protective padding so, for extra I keep mine inside its own zipper sleeve- and the opening does accommodate the laptop with a sleeve. (Just an added step is needed here!)<br \/><br \/>I appreciate the shoulder strap is adjustable- being only 5\u20192\u201d.. I need this shortened quite a bit and take note- strap can also be removed 100%.. nice options for carrying. The base feels stalky enough in structure to provide a platform for bag to sit upright with structure.. only, over time as leather wears- this may dissipate as I can feel under weight, it\u2019s starting to bow a bit in the middle.<br \/><br \/>This has the finishings and attention to detail one would expect at a $40 price point\u2026 this sends off almost a western\/cowboy vibe- and not sure why!? Maybe leather, color, style, clasps.. ??! Let\u2019s just say, it doesn\u2019t scream NYC or Miami Beach- but, in utah it fits right in!<br \/>My only complaint would be the top-heavy flap and buckles\u2026 these can be a bit of a nuisance on some level. Wanting bag to stay sturdy and upright when opened- it doesn\u2019t agree with that! The weight of flap keeps tipping bag over in open position.. to correct issue I must lean against chair or wall when open- but, not very ideal.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a solid bag for everyday use.. with a few quirky caveats to consider. Hoping this info can help in making your decision- i\u2019d recommend for first time\/younger user or, causal workday needs."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Very Compact & Light","text":"I just started using my camera yesterday and my first impression is that this thing seems very fragile.  Hope I don't drop it, as it might not survive the fall.  It is extremely small, light and compact.  Think of two packs of cigarettes or two packs of playing cards.  It is that small.  Great for travel due to the light weight and compactness.  Got it for about $90 on sale; would hate to pay more than that for it. Very easy to operate, but if you have big hands, this will be too small for you.  Be warned that it won't take more than a couple minutes of video without a memory card, so you'll have to put a little more money into it if you really want to do video or really much of anything.  The first video I took came out pretty decent, but it was in good light.  I tried some still shots inside at night and they came out very dark in spite of the flash.  The flash doesn't seem adequate, so this is probably a camera best used outdoors or in the daytime.  Great camera for a kid.  This is a good camera for small hands and a great size for kids.  If they break it or lose it, you aren't out a bundle.  As another reviewer pointed out, it does only take video in the ASF format; not MPEG, as the advertising suggests.  I think MPEG might be just music files.  I didn't need to install the software to capture the pictures or movies on my computer (Windows XP).  Another great thing is that this is a complete package.  It has the camera, a carrying strap, a carrying case, USB cable, TV cables, headphones, battery, battery charger and software.  It does not come with a lens cap and the cap is not available either.  You can buy an optional tripod for it and with the small size, I think that could be useful in some situations to help hold and stabilize the camera.  I am not sure how you store music on it; I probably won't use that feature, but it seems like it would be a nice compact music player; again you'll need a memory card to save much of anything on it.  One problem I had so far.  The memory card (which you have to buy separately--a standard SD card) slips in the bottom under a little rubber membrane.  The first time I held the camera I accidentally popped out the card and lost the shots I was trying to take.  This might be a problem and I am thinking I may have to put a piece of heavy tape over the bottom to hold the membrane and memory chip in place and prevent ejecting the memory again.  Another downside that I see is the battery.  You can't just pick up some spare batteries at the corner store and pop them in.  You have to use the special rechargeable battery.  If you don't have a spare one charged up, your camera will go dead and you'll have to wait until you can plug in the charger and recharge the battery.  That's another $20 for a spare battery.  My digital camera uses standard AA batteries, so I can use either rechargeables or regular batteries.  If this camera used regular batteries, it would make it larger and heavier, so the small rechargeable does help on the weight and size.  Don't buy this if you are a serious photographer.  Buy it for occasional use, for easy portability and as a first camera to learn on.  Controls are easy and straightforward.  Nice camera for the money, but not for serious photographers.  It does a lot for a tiny little thing; sure doesn't make me want to go back to the days of huge video cameras that you had to hold on your shoulder, due to the weight.  Minaturization can go too far and this is about as small as I would ever want to go; might be easier to use if it was just a tiny bit bigger."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"A STUNNING Li'l RADIO! Hearing Aid Users Take Note!","text":"I don't usually purchase products that require earbuds because I have considerable hearing loss. However, I took a chance on this little radio and I am VERY glad I did. I can hear this radio extremely well -- it has a tremendous amount of volume power considering its size (4\" long, about the size of a cell phone). It has AM & FM bands, stereo\/mono setting, can be used w\/out the earbuds as a regular radio. It also allows memory pre-sets of your favorite stations. The radio attaches to your belt via a removable plastic clip.<br \/><br \/>If you use hearing aids,you will need to remove them to use the earbuds, of course. I suppose you could try a different headset device -- one that can be used WITH hearing aids. I have found that I can hear this radio very well with the use of the earbuds.

This would be a perfect gift for a graduate to use in college or, one commuting to work in city or, to hip new job- it most definitely carries professional vibe look but, does it in a hip way! This would be ideal for anyone carrying more than just a laptop to\/from work- as it has plenty of safe and secure room for multiple electronics or, camera equipment, and would be a dream for professional who travels for work.. it has the strap to attach it to luggage and makes navigating the airport a lot more hands free!<br \/>We got this for my 25yr old post grad. son, to transport smaller video equipment and laptop to work on motorcycle in the summer..  Surprising, it can be worn just like a backpack- (Including strap to hold it secure) and yet, as you walk into office- it transforms into corporate world with ease!<br \/><br \/>The outer layer feels almost neoprene-ish and I love how entire pack is formed\/molded to have a harder exterior- it stand on its own which is so  convenient to get things in and out as needed and also gives extra protection. The zippers are smooth and we haven\u2019t had any issue catching the inner and ever dreaded inside zipper lining. We first were using a leather backpack to perform same duties as it looked nice yet, but was not reinforced or practical and was so slouchy.. this looks just as nice as the same style in leather because.. it\u2019s not marked up with cheesy colors or branding (we got solid black) and are thrilled with the choice..<br \/>The nice thing is- this looks like professional bag but, has all the smaller sections and creatures comforts that are appreciated in a backpack. I love the front pocket- great for wallet\/ID\/airline info\/ Cel phone\/keys\/etc.. all in there neat little spot. Im telling you, those with OCD will love this bag!!<br \/><br \/>The bonus feature with this bag- is the usb charging port. NO! This isn\u2019t a Tesla magic bag.. that magically provides power. You must add a battery charge pack to the inside outlet. And yess, you\u2019ll have to charge up the battery pack as needed- BUT,  if you do this and have a device  running now such as\u2026 Delayed in an airport or, no access to an outlet \u2013 you can plug into your own bag and keep device running strong. No, we did not use this flying with the airlines yet as, I\u2019m hoping there will be no issue with the extra battery supply? ( I know there were issues with things come busting me at flight\u2026 I\u2019m guessing this is not one of them?! )<br \/>If you are looking to get or give a nice \u201ccorporate style\u201d bag with all the bells and whistle\u2019s\u2026this is hands down worth it and one that won\u2019t I stand behind and feel, will not disappoint !<br \/>*The only suggestion I have for manufacture would be: include a battery boost pack with the sale of the backpack and have this item be all inclusive.. it would also assure your battery pack would fit and show where\/how it fits\/connects.. and keeps things simple. (I had to buy a  separate boost and guess on what would fit\u2026 When giving the bag as a gift. As I want it everything needed to be ready upon gifting.

I averaged 60 fps with major lag spikes in teamfights in League of legends a 10+ year old game. I expected 120+ with the screen at 144hz. But it wasn't the screen holding me back it was the gpu, I guess. Also had poor performance in Dota 2. I wouldn't recommend this laptop. Also the volume on the speakers never rose over 50% it seemed.

It is apparently working right now.  If it develops an issue I will update this review.  But for now, it turned out to be this 8 year old's favorite gift. Amazon makes it easy to gift whenever I want... wrapped or not.  I do wish Amazon would get some &#34;kid&#34; wrapping paper... the stock blue with gold ribbon is great for adults... but a little cheerier option for kids would be so nice!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"What will think of next","text":"Wow, we connected our apple air laptop and started to run some tests on it: first we went straight to apple's trailer and played the new pirates of the carribean on 1080p hd- totally gobsmacked with the color quality and definition. We were very impressed. Needless to say, we played more action trailers and the LED screen did a beautiful job.  We then ran our portable DVD player and the same Great play back results.  Okay, there is no speakers on the screen, but our DVD attachments we can hook up external speakers to get the fuller sound effects.<br \/><br \/>The thinness is a huge plus, the quality of picture is awesome. And it accepts hdmi.<br \/>The slight neg is that there is no VESA mount, so it must remain on the mount it comes with that only pivots back and forth at about a 30 degree angle.  To complete the esthetic look, on the front of the base mount are six easy touch positions to adjust brightness, color resolution, etc (very nice that this feature is so nicely hidden).  To keep everything green,the manual is on  cd!<br \/>Hmm, the base mount is a finger print magnet!<br \/><br \/>We are synched about this new LED and for the price.. It is a tad expensive for a standard computer screen!  But for someone who watches a lot of movies off their computers, or the reruns of shows on hbo and abc, play action games.. Then this is so worth it.  To tell you the truth, this quality level will soon become standard in a few years."}

It would have been nice to add some features that allow you to change the aperture, for example (not a lot, just some).  Otherwise, this camera is very intelligent and takes great pictures (in wide screen form too that allows you to view it on one's HD TV with no black bars on either side); the mini movie feature is excellent and pick up sound a long way off too.  Recommend you to get a 16gb disc to go with it as the movie can take a lot of space!  Highly recommended as a compact camera"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Only Partial Blackout for Person Sitting Alongside Leaning In","text":"This 3M EASY-ON PRIVACY FILTER FOR IPAD2 offers fairly decent privacy, but it doesn't black out your screen for someone standing behind you (looking over your shoulder) or black out the screen completely for someone sitting beside you and leaning in.  It offers privacy for the vertical (portrait) iPad position only--which is actually a nice feature, since you can hold your iPad up in the horizontal (landscape) position to share with anyone and everyone nearby without removing the filter.<br \/><br \/>Installation is extremely simple.  You stick small adhesive patches on each of the four corners of the stiff plastic filter, then gently stick the filter onto your iPad.  (Check to make sure you have an iPad 2 or 3rd\/4th generation iPad, because the cutouts for the home screen button and front-facing camera must match up.)  The filter goes on bubble-free, without any need for a cardboard \"squeegee\".<br \/><br \/>The privacy filter is easy to remove.  The kit includes a heavy plastic sleeve for storing the filter after you've added the corner stickers, and also includes four extra corner stickers for when the first set of stickers wears out.  You need to use some care when removing the filter:  on my first attempt, three of the sticky corners stayed on the iPad.  Probably that was because I applied the filter on top of existing screen protector film and pressed the corners down firmly.  On my second application, I pressed the corners down quite gently, and the stickers stayed on the filter when I removed it for the second time.<br \/><br \/>Because the privacy filter doesn't completely black out the screen when someone is sitting close by you, I rate it at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale)."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Saves Money Over Time","text":"If you're still leasing a cable modem, you're throwing money away every month. It's much cheaper to simply purchase one outright. The catch is that you have to make sure that it's one approved by your cable company. This one is compatible with the top providers. It works well and has an easy setup process if you install the app. You'll have to contact your provider to get them to activate it. That might be a bit of a pain, but it's worth it. I like Netgear because their products don't become obsolete as fast as some other brands. Their customer service is very efficient if you should need to contact them. Overall, I highly recommend this product.<br \/><br \/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"AmazonBasics Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Combo - Full Size - US Layout (QWERTY)","text":"Keyboard measures 18.3 by 7.3 by 0.8 inches. First wireless keyboard for me and the setup instructions were basic. There is no power switch for the keyboard. You put the mouse dongle into your computer, make sure Bluetooth is set to 'on',  and it will 'pair'. Why I am giving the gorgeous keyboard 3 stars is that the keys are 'sticky.' I am not one who pounds their keyboard and that is what you have to do. For the oldsters out there it is 'stickier' than an electric typewriter. I find myself tapping the keys and missing letters. The stickiest is the space bar. Final analysis is that it is usable just not as responsive as I am used to with the wired keyboards I have used."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"All I can politely write is that what an amazing experience.  freaking AWESOME","text":"All I can politely write is that what an amazing experience.  The headphones are small and just sit over the ears (like their noise canceling headphones).  The Bluetooth component sits neatly inside the headphones, as we have another Bose Bluetooth headphones and the Bluetooth component sits outside of the headphones.  I synced this with iPad, iPhone and iPod Classic (using Kokkia I10).  The quality of the sound is fabulous as you would expect from BOSE ( a lot of bass) you will not be disappointed.  I played a range of music from rock, pop and classical music...awesomeness is the experience with Bose!  The range is not miles...more like 20 feet..and not through too many walls. ...terrific design of compactness and total comfort on my ears.  In terms of external noise, it really did cut out the concrete jungle living of traffic hum.<br \/><br \/>I listened to my music for over an hour now and no pain on my ears...bliss and worth every cent and pennies.  I love these new BOSE Bluetooth headphones.  Note, they come fully charged.  There are little and discreet volume up and down buttons, which are elevated a little so it is easy to find and you will not end up pushing the wrong button.  I didn't have to press any additional button to synch..there is a voice telling you that it is seeking to synch..and will let you know when it has connected. There is a button to switch from music to speak on the phone.  Crystal clear.  It comes with a power charge..a micro USB cable and a RCA cable.(hmm redundant with Bluetooth, but if you have digital piano, you can connect it via the RCA.  I am going to get the Bluetooth adaptor to test it with these head phones).<br \/><br \/>The headphones remember all the names of the gadgets, and will play from which ever one that is 'on', which is a huge plus.  There appears to be an intelligence here that we do not see in the Bose over the ear wireless headphones.<br \/><br \/>In term of play time, after a full charge, which took less than 2 hours: total playtime is more like 8 hours, not 15 hours claimed, but it must be related to the volume too.  I had my volume pretty high most of the time.  Given, how quickly it charged up, and the number of hours of playtime, I really don't need to charge it up for more than one every three days.<br \/>Also comes with a compact and stylish case to store the wires and headphones when not in use."}

It was a must to support various devices and this hits them all!! Various connective options was a must for our group and so far, we\u2019ve used with a play box for gaming, a nightly movie watch and photo stix of Christmas vacation!! My daughter is thrilled to be taking this back to her dorm!<br \/><br \/>This has auto focus and had no issue getting a clear picture @ 120\u201d and that was size we went bc of our screen size- it says it can even go up to 220\u201d but, didn\u2019t have that capacity to try! At 180\u201d edges were not distorted or blurred.. and best of all the picture is bright!! (I bring up brightness specifically bc this was issue with our previous old school projector- it never was bright enough..)<br \/><br \/>As always I let you know if instructions are necessary- and yes! I suggest read manual for your varied set up then, keep it stored with projector for easy refresh on hookup- especially when connecting to many different options! **YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO GET A PROTECTIVE CARRY CASE!! Something to keep items contained and protected and all-in-one spot.. Trust me on this one- you should be gentle with any projector lens.. although made for some wear\/tear- excessive jarring or bumping can effect units picture and functionality for obvious reasons! A case eliminates a lot of worries during travel or storing. **this is the x1 item missing with this projector set..at least ours didn\u2019t include!!<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a solid find- sold at a higher price point then some @ $120..

Best of all, when I need contact\u2026 It\u2019s my voice he hears over the walkie without any need to answer or push any buttons- it\u2019s leaves no escape from communication! Of course, to respond one simply needs to push in a button to do so. These have also proved helpful on larger size property we reside on in Utah- my husband can take this out to the north 40 letting me reach him with ease.. range is approx. 700yds. and we still have crystal clear com.\u2019s- impressive!! These would be ideal for small businesses where a stock room or outdoor space is out of vocal range.. they are not commercial grade to suffice a large multi level building or campus- but these do the job far above a child\u2019s toy for sure. Which brings up a useful idea if kids are outside playing on your street- These would be easy to keep contact both directions..Great to meet smaller need options.<br \/><br \/>To use: simply turn on and program both walkies to the same channel. Easy to do- how do you change option a recorded voice lets you know exactly what channel you are on. Then it\u2019s as easy as depressing the button to speak\u2026 Letting go to listen! Comes with rechargeable batteries and charge cord for both devices- fully charged gives users a green light. Note: these are still usable plugged in to a power source as well. We charge each night and battery lasts all day to avoid a low battery issue- keep things easy!<br \/><br \/>Light weight- One won\u2019t be encumbered with excess bulk it\u2019s size of adult hand- save photos included for up close charging, size comp.\u2019s, green light, etc.. each unit has belt clip and also can be connected to lanyard as well.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A little confusing to set up; good quality picture","text":"Due to the poor English in the manual, I was a little confused about setting this up.  At first I thought I could connect it to my computer and do the setup, but it doesn't work from a computer.  Apparently you connect to the computer just to download videos it has taken.  I finally figured out that you have to connect it to your vehicle to set time and date and format the internal storage (which it tells you to do before first use).  The battery charge lasts only seconds after being unplugged from your computer or your car, so there is not time enough to make any settings with it unplugged.  Getting into the menus that you need to make initial settings was a bit confusing, but I finally got it figured out.  The suction cup worked okay for me; other reviewers have complained about it.  Maybe it will fall off after a while, but so far, so good.  The picture quality is good and it has a nice wide viewing angle.  I haven't tried downloading any of the video yet, but I'm sure it is not difficult.  Good camera that would be better with clearer instructions.  There were some strange looking small pieces included in plastic bag and I don't know what they are for; no explanation that I could find and no obvious use.  Maybe included by mistake?"}

The sound is pretty good, too. My daughter has used this in the backyard with friends and it was more than adequate. We have found it easier to control the volume with our phones than the actual device, but you can control it from the speaker, too. The light feature is fun at night.

Finally, I splashed out on this light and it is pretty much all love: super super light that I really don't feel its extra weight, powered from the kindle, great light coverage for the kindle 3, easy to attach, and does not feel obtrusive even though it makes the left buttons defunct: i didnt notice as I can equally use the right buttons.<br \/>Although it has an on-off switch, the light will only come on if the kindle is not in sleep mode, hence if you fall asleep and the kindle goes into sleep mode, it automatically switches itself off!<br \/><br \/>I noticed that the light actually adds to the hold of the kindle: gives it more grip.<br \/><br \/> If you like me, love to read the kindle without a cover, without the added weight, and conscious of the green impact of replacement batteries, this is the kindle light for you!<br \/><br \/>8\/25 edit: just bought the RooCase super bubble case for kindle3:  love it, it has enough wiggle room to fit both the kindle and attached SimpleLight together.  Super price a d great color choices too."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Good for general lighting needs","text":"I finally buckled and purchased this inexpensive light ring for online work: teaching on Zoom, meeting with my students (college instructor here), conferences, etc. I'm not a TikTok\/YouTube influencer, but I appreciate portraying my online presence in the best light (pardon the pun, I had to :)<br \/><br \/>Although there weren't any instructions, the assembly is rather intuitive, even for a novice like myself. I did appreciate that the laptop brace is held together by a metal clip rather than plastic, as are the screws to adjust the brace and swivel the light itself. The USB can handily plug into your computer.<br \/><br \/>Lastly, the light itself has three choices: warm, what I'd call warmish cool (in between cool and warm), and cool. With every level, there are 10 gradients within each one providing about 30 different lighting choices. Play around and figure out which works best with your skin tone and lighting.<br \/><br \/>Here's to my first day getting heavy use out of the ring light (during three Zoom meetings) and crossing my fingers for longevity. I'm presenting at a symposium tomorrow and looking forward to putting my best *glowy face* forward."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Lightening fast portable memory in a tiny \"package\"","text":"I purchased this for two reasons.  First I wanted a memory card that I could use in my [[ASIN:B00966PFHW Philips DVT1000\/00 2 GB Digital Voice Tracer with 2 Built-In Microphones Voice Recorder]].  Second I also wanted to copy and store many photos from my laptop on this card.  I was able to do both without losing the files associated with either system.<br \/><br \/>Not only did this card work in both my Dell Inspiron 1720 with Windows Vista Service Pack 2 but it also worked fine in my [[ASIN:B00966PFHW Philips DVT1000\/00 2 GB Digital Voice Tracer with 2 Built-In Microphones Voice Recorder]] (without the reader).<br \/><br \/>Using my Dell's USB 2.0 port and the reader that came with the card, I was able to transfer 330 photo files (a total of 485 MB) in under three minutes which to me is extremely impressive.  What is also impressive is that this is so, so tiny.  I don't stay up on technology much any more, but if this got any smaller I would have to use a magnifying glass and tweezer just to remove the card from the reader and insert it into my recorder. The card has a nice indent in it so you can pull it out with your nail (that's if you have finger nails).<br \/><br \/>I got this on gold box special for $26.99 instead of the current price of $68.24 and now I'm sorry I didn't buy two.  In summary this is fast, small, and portable memory with lots of storage!  Perhaps there's something better out there but I'm so satisfied I'm not looking!"}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"An amazing e-Book reader with numerous extras.","text":"I received a Kindle 2 as a gift recently. I'd had my eye on the Kindle since its launch, but couldn't justify the high price tag. I use several forms of portable technology including an HTC touchscreen smartphone, but the Kindle 2 was my first eBook reader. Opening the Kindle 2 was an experience: Amazon has cleverly packaged the Kindle in minimally wasteful packaging; the box itself is very clever and space-saving, and the USB cord is tucked into the two-prong adapter (so if, like me, you initially think that they forgot to include the USB cable, just pop the prong adapter off the end).<br \/><br \/>First, the size: the Kindle 2 measures about 8 inches by 5 inches by .36 (it's literally thinner than a Number 2 pencil), so it's about the same size as a paperback without the thickness (or the weight). It weighs only 10.2 ounces, so it's easy to slide it into a large purse or backpack. The display is large and crystal clear, but is only in black and white, so if you're getting magazine or newspaper subscriptions, be aware. There are sixteen shades of grey, though, so photos and illustrations have a lot of depth and contrast despite being in black and white. There are six different text sizes available if you have problems with too-small fonts, but the Kindle screen isn't backlit, so this won't work in low light without a reading light. There's also the controversial text-to-speech feature, which is the same technology that's come with Windows OS for years; a synthesized voice (male or female) will \"read\" the text out loud (there's a 3.5mm headphone jack if you want to listen in private). After the Authors' Guilld threatened to sue Amazon.com over the feature, publishers have the right to disable it on Kindle versions, so be aware that the text-to-speech feature may not work on all Kindle books.<br \/><br \/>You can purchase and download Kindle books instantly using the Kindle 2's free Whispernet (an EVDO modem with fallback to 1xRTT that uses's Sprint's 3G network). Most New York Times Bestsellers are available in Kindle editions, which are typically $9.99. There are no Kindle rentals; once you've downloaded the book, it's yours. However, there are numerous free Kindle books to be found on Amazon.com and elsewhere; simply click on the Kindle Books tab at Amazon.com and set to sort by price ($0.00 titles show up first). Many of the free Kindle texts are based on older (think 19th-century) authors and are transcribed by volunteers, so they may not be exactly what you were expecting. You can either purchase Kindle books from your PC and have them sent wirelessly to your Kindle, or you can browse and purchase directly from the Kindle, but be careful: Kindle books are purchased via 1-click, which means that you could accidentally purchase something you'd only intended to look at. The download time depends on the size of the book; for a text-only book, it took less than a minute to download. When  I downloaded a larger book with illustrations, it took several minutes.<br \/><br \/>Reading on the Kindle is much like reading a paperback; the Kindle \"disappears\" as you read. However, the page turning is a bit jarring, since every time you turn a page, the screen flashes in contrast (at first I thought that it was some sort of flaw or bug). The previous page button is on the left edge, while there's a next page button on both sides of the Kindle, so page turning is easy (other than the screen flashing). On the downside, you can't flip several pages ahead easily without repeatedly clicking the \"next\" button. With a real paperback, you'd simply thumb through the pages.<br \/><br \/>There is no expandable memory slot, but the Kindle 2 features 2GB (1.4 GB for user content) of internal memory that will hold up to 1,500 books as well as documents (PDF, HTML, DOC, JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP through conversion) and MP3 music and AAX Audible audiobook files. You can even set up customized MP3 music playlists (it's under \"experimental\") by dragging files into the \"Music\" folder on the Kindle by hooking it up to your PC via the included USB 2.0 cable. If you have documents that are in another format (the Kindle native format is .AZW), you have two choices for conversion: either e-mail the documents to your Kindle e-mail (your regular e-mail ended with @kindle.com) for a ten-cent conversion charge (you'll be billed when your conversion balance reaches $3.00) or to your email @free.kindle.com (you then must drag-and-drop the file onto your Kindle from your PC, but there's no fee to convert the file).<br \/><br \/>The Kindle also features a basic Web browser that handles text-only versions fairly well, and a built-in dictionary. You're able to highlight, put in page markers and add notes to Kindle books, making it a useful tool for study or research. There's a full QWERTY keyboard and a five-way toggle that takes some getting used to. The menu designs are drop down similar to Windows; you simply move through the various options using the five-way controller, then press down on it to select.<br \/><br \/>The battery can hold a charge for up to four days with the Whispernet on; you'll get a much longer charge if you turn it off. It takes about three hours to fully charge the battery, but it's not user-replaceable; you have to mail your Kindle to Amazon.com for a replacement. The battery is covered for the first year after purchase, but it's $59 after that. The Kindle 2 also doesn't come with [[ASIN:B001JAH7OM Amazon Kindle 2 Leather Cover]], for which you'll have to shell out extra money unless you choose to store it in the box.<br \/><br \/>If you love new technology and are looking for new ways to read \/ listen on the go, the Kindle 2 may be a good choice for you. But besides the initial expense, the Kindle versions of paperbacks are as expensive as their paper counterparts. Depending on your area, the Whispernet may not have a strong signal (and for now, the Kindle 2 is only available in the US, so overseas customers will have to wait). I love mine, but it's up to you whether it's worth the cost of the Kindle 2 and book downloads."}

So glad I found this this leather rooCase, which I have had long enough to be convinced it was the right choice, the best case out there in my view.<br \/><br \/>The quality is superb and the price is very fair: real leather of good quality for only $38.<br \/><br \/>A snap connects the inner leather sleeve \/ glove to the folding zipper case, which acts as a base and back so you can view the Kindle in portrait or landscape on almost any surface including an uneven bed -- even when your leaning nearby on the mattress makes the case slope slightly forward.<br \/><br \/>There's plenty of air space around the sleeve along with openings for charging, on-off, volume control, and the speakers. Because of the good airflow, it runs 2-3 degrees centigrade cooler than when flat on a surface. My Kindle was getting too hot laying on my bed and had occasional freeze problems because of the heat. No more!!<br \/><br \/>The case itself is made of high quality leather and has two zippers so you can zip from either side. I haven't used the case like a portfolio, but the inside compartments are well made and it would be very functional as a traveling case, offering protection and space for cards, etc. It isn't high style, but it's a handsome case."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Superior Cleaning Cloth for Touchscreen Devices","text":"The large size (5\"x7\") and extra thickness of this TODDY GEAR MICRO FIBER SMART CLOTH are what make it a superior cleaning cloth for large touchscreen devices (in my case, an iPad2, a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet, and a Nexus 7 tablet).  The \"plush\" side (loopy, like a washcloth) removes greasy fingerprints quickly, and the \"silk\" (microfiber) side polishes to finish the job.<br \/><br \/>The Smart Cloth works fine with screen protector film (all my touchscreen devices have film).  It is much easier to handle than a thin, slippery, microfiber square.  Also, the cloth's plush side does an excellent job of absorbing skin oil (unlike my microfiber cloths for cleaning eyeglasses that quickly acquire an oily coating and need frequent washing).<br \/><br \/>Additional nice features are:  (1) the Aegis Microbe Shield\u00ae protection, which helps protect the cloth against mold and mildew; and (2) the fact that the cloth is stain and wrinkle resistant and machine washable.  The cloth comes in a clear plastic storage bag that has a nice zipper closure.<br \/><br \/>The microfiber side of the Smart Cloth comes in a wide assortment of prints:  flags, bubble dots, stripes, jacquards, flowers, etc.  This beautiful design, Aizuri, is my personal favorite, but there are quite a few other prints that I like almost as well."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Near-Perfect  Faux Crocodile Cover With Intriguing Stand Design","text":"I love the look and feel of this VERSO \"DARWIN\" CROCCO standing cover for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet.  Red is my favorite color, and the faux crocodile texture is really fun.<br \/><br \/>This cover holds the tablet firmly with silicone-enhanced elastic corner bands (patent pending).  The bands have a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it, so the tablet does not slide around inside the cover or want to fall out.  (I have screen protector film on my tablet, which seems like a good idea when a tablet is held in place by elastic bands rather than a hard plastic shell.  This [[ASIN:B009NHU556 3-Pack Ultra-Clear Screen Protector)]] is easy to apply, and you get three chances to get it on right.)<br \/><br \/>The cover's built-in stands are quite intriguing.  There are two of them attached to the inside of the front cover.  One stand supports the tablet at a low angle for typing; the other supports it more or less upright for watching movies.  Both provide comfortable viewing angles.  The stands themselves  are flat, microfiber-covered pieces that match the rest of the cover's interior.  You pick the stand angle you want, and open out the appropriate stand.  The stand is connected to the cover on top and also with a ribbon underneath, so that the stand converts into a triangular support for your tablet.  This design is very clever, and I would consider it perfect if I hadn't already tried the [[ASIN:B009X0167Y Marware Vibe Standing Case]], which is a little easier to set up and offers more viewing angles.<br \/><br \/>This Verso \"Darwin\" Crocco cover has an elastic band that holds it tightly closed inside a book or tote bag, as well as an automatic magnetic wake\/sleep feature.  For the wake\/sleep feature to work, you must insert your tablet with the camera at the left and the charging port at the right.  This I don't like, because the charging port ends up at the tablet's bottom edge when you use the stands.  This means you are limited to using the low-angle stand whenever your tablet is plugged in, because the plug contacts the table top.  (With the Marware Vibe cover, the charging port ends up at the tablet's top edge, so you can use the tablet at any angle when it's plugged in.)<br \/><br \/>According to the accompanying retail literature, this  Verso \"Darwin\" Crocco cover is \"compatible\" with the Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", the Nook HD+, \"and more\".  Because the cover holds the tablet with elastic bands, it should fit any tablet near in size to the large Fire or the large Nook.  However, it is definitely too small for an iPad 2.<br \/><br \/>For me, it's difficult to choose between the Marware Vibe cover and the Verso \"Darwin\" cover.  But in the end, as usually happens, good looks win out.  My 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet is going to stay in the red faux-crocodile-skin cover, which is eye-catching, looks and feels luxurious, and is extremely well made."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Okay as an amp; only one type of input; serious range limitation on remote control","text":"This is a decent power amplifier.  I had an old large amp powering the external speakers from my television and that died.  This small amp fits much better in the spot where the big amp was, which was sitting on end to fit in available space.  The Lepy is small enough to fit just about anywhere.  A few problems with the Lepy.  First of all, there is only one input jack, which is the single plug 3.5 mm size.  Fortunately I had the proper audio cord, but regular RCA input jacks would be nice.  There are RCA output jacks for two speakers, as well as the &#34;pinch&#34; type speaker connectors.  With my old amp when I muted the TV, it also muted the amp.  Not sure how this worked, but muting the TV now does not mute the output to the Lepy.  Possibly because I had to use a different output jack from the TV, which may not mute external output.  The Lepy doesn't seem to work with the other output jacks that my old amp was plugged into.  You can mute or adjust the volume on the LEPY with the knobs or with a remote, but I don't want to get up and walk across the room to adjust the knobs.  The problem with the remote is that it appears to only have about a 10 foot range.  We want to control it from about a 12-15 foot distance, which just is not possible.  The remote doesn't seem to work past about 9 to 10 feet.  Possibly the battery on it is low, but since it was brand new, I doubt that.  The final problem is that there is really no instructions with the box, so you really have to play with it and guess what the various buttons do.  Also, what happens when you plug in an SD card or USB stick?  Does it automatically search for and play audio files?  There is no instructions on using those inputs.  The box does have a built-in FM radio, but I couldn't figure out how to easily tune it; it appears to be just up and down to find a station.  I wouldn't want to use it as an FM radio, as it appears that it is not able to get anything but the strongest stations.  An AM tuner would have been nice too."}

I'm talking about great sound accross all types of music and a very comfortable fit, with plenty of options for ear size or activity. Bass is clean\/deep and all tones in between are also great and crisp. Also plenty of power to crank if you'd like, which I have found lacking in plenty of BT headsets. I have no doubt you won't regret.<br \/><br \/>I'm not big on head set phone calls but they work fine with my iPhone 6.<br \/><br \/>Edit... more listening and I like them even more.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A Harmony user and works with a mac","text":"Let me start by saying that my first universal remote was the Marantz RC2000.  This thing was called the \"Remote of the Gods\" by Home Theater Magazine\".  This device could control all of my components and came with 4 macro buttons, which allowed me to turn on my TV then my cable box and then set the controls on the remote for that cable box.  It was a great remote but not very \"Wife\" friendly.  It was big, heavy and chewed through AA batteries.<br \/><br \/>That was then this is now.  I just replaced my aging Logitech Harmony 880 (with failing button contacts) with the Logitech 900.  The 880 was a fantastic leap forward with an activity \"macro\" based remote that walked you through the setup.  The reason I know that the Harmony 880 was good was that once it was setup I never though about it again.  It just worked.<br \/><br \/>The Logitech Harmony 900 builds on its predecessors.  Unfortunately, you have to create a new account when setting up the Harmony 900.  It cannot pick up your settings from an older Harmony remote.  No a huge deal but if you haven't looked at the model numbers on your equipment in a few years this can be a bit of a pain.  To ease that pain you should probably login to your original Harmony account and right down the make and model #s of all your equipment.<br \/><br \/>Initial setup was a bit different than the Harmony 880.  No I should let you know that I setup the remote on Mac running OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard).  When connecting a Harmony 880 it gets detected and just works.  The Harmony 900 gets detected as 2 devices.  The first is the remote and the second is a network device.  This surprised me at first but probably has something to do with the way the remote communicates with the RF receiver.  Once you create your account and connect the unit it will download and update it's firmware.  This will take a few minutes and then the remote will reboot.<br \/><br \/>It will then ask you to start listing your devices.  In my case it was 7 (TV, DVD Player, TiVo Series 3, A\/V Receiver, XBOX 360, a lighting controller and a Playstation 3.  A special note about using a Playstation 3, the PS3 uses Bluetooth for its controllers and remote.  It does not support Infrared.  Logitech does sell an IR to Bluetooth transmitter for around $50.  If you want to save some money pick up Nyko's Bluewave IR Dongle and Remote (for about $15).  If you have the Bluewave don't add the Playstation 3 as a device, just add the Nyko Bluewave and system will understand that you have a PS3.<br \/><br \/>The setup was relatively painless.  I had to manually setup the Lutron lighting controller.  No when I say \"manually\" I don't mean that I had to have the Harmony 900 learn the commands.  Logitech had the codes in its database.  I mean that I had to go into the activities and add the \"Lights On\" and \"Lights Off\" to the Soft Buttons section.<br \/><br \/>The build quality of the 900 remote seems to be better than the 880.  It has a sturdier feel with a rubber bottom for better grip.  The screen and graphics are at a higher resolution and there is a nice bit of sliding animation when moving between pages. The remote fits in the charging cradle quite snugly with little room to miss the contacts (unlike early versions of the 880 charger).<br \/><br \/>I don't have any equipment at the moment that needs the RF portion of this remote so I can't comment on it.  I'm sure there are several written and video reviews that cover this.<br \/><br \/>Over all I would recommend this remote for people who are somewhat technical.  For people who have many components (and don't want to spend thousands on a Crestron controller) this is a must have."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"WORKS GREAT FOR CABLED CONNECTIONS; PASS THROUGH OUTLET NICE, BUT NEEDS SLIGHT REDESIGN","text":"Other reviewers will probably cover the wi-fi setup, but I got this for another reason.  I hate wi-fi because it can be slow, too many things can interfere with the signal (such as microwaves) and there is always a security concern.  In addition to being a wi-fi extender, this works great for extending the range of your router's wired connections, which is how I am using it.  There are two parts to this; one is the sending end, which you plug into your router via included ethernet cable and then into an electrical outlet.  The receiving end of this has 3 ethernet ports and you can connect up to 3 devices by ethernet cable.  If you use it this way, there is no setup at all.  It truly is plug and play and worked immediately for me.  The setup sheet doesn't make it clear that it can function this way, but there is a picture on the box showing it.  Also, I was very pleased with the fact that both pieces included a pass-through outlet, which is a great feature.  It would seem that this would keep you from losing an outlet.  Maybe and maybe not.  Here's why.  Both pieces are quite long.  If you plug them into the top outlet of a typical 2 part outlet, the devices will cover the second outlet.  So just plug them into the bottom outlet, right?; then the top outlet is free.  Maybe.  The problem is that the devices are just a little too tall and you cannot fit a 3-prong gounded plug above them.  You can use a 2-pronged plug and it will mostly likely fit.  You would think someone would have tested this when they designed the product.  It's that slight design flaw that caused me to knock one star off my rating.  Other extenders of this type that I have seen are small enough to fit with another 3-prong cord above them when plugged in to the bottom of a 2-part outlet.<br \/><br \/>If you have a large house, it is possible you might have more than one main electrical circuit running through your house.  This only works if you plug both devices into the same master circuit.  Of course that is not the fault of the device; that will be true of any range extender of this type.<br \/><br \/>These power plug range extenders have been on the market for a while, but nice someone finally decided to include a pass-through outlet, but too bad that the device isn't just a little smaller so that it doesn't partially block the second plug in a 2-plug outlet when plugged in at the bottom.  Note these do need to be plugged directly into a wall outlet; can't be used off a power strip.  That could be an issue if you are short of outlets, as I am.<br \/><br \/>The connection speed wasn't quite as good as I expected, but it is adequate.  The units heated up a little, which I didn't like, but not uncomfortable to the touch. I also have experience with standalone extenders that don't use the powerlines in your home; they work just about as well and some of them also have ethernet ports; the only difference being that you are going Wi-Fi to the extender and then going back to ethernet if you want to use a cable, whereas with a powerline extender, you are going through wires all the way.  Those standalone extenders only require one outlet too.<br \/><br \/>I have used other TP-Link products and generally they seem to be of good quality, so I don't hesitate in any way to use their brand.  Made in China, which is common for electronics products."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Home Theater System","text":"The Panasonic SC-HTB15 is a great Home Theater System. It was unfortunate that I was not able to install this myself due to the way my current Panasonic Viera television is set up (it was wall mounted by a professional) so I needed to call in someone to do this for me. I watched the tech set it up and seemed to be relatively easy to do (once he was able to get to the wall mounted television). If I had the television on a standard table mount I am sure I coud have easily set this up myself. Once installed, all I can say is 'Wow' to the quality of the sound. The technician set up the speakers similar to the way it is displayed on the Amazon page, one on each side of the television wall mounted. To me, the sound rivaled any 4 speaker system out there and fro, the second it was turned on, filled my entire room with beautiful crystal clear sound. If there were any drawbacks at all it would be that I wish the system was wireless (so I didn't have to go through the expense of the installation). But, as I mentioned, I do have a wall mount which is my own drawback I guess. I would recommend this system to anyone to use in a family room or living room with a large screen tv (I love the Viera model so I am slightly prejudiced when it comes to the Panasonic name)."}

A mega set of clips (96 in all) divided over 6 individual packs- these could be helpful and plentiful enough to take on a commercial or classroom task, a project at the office or, as we found useful.. hanging up the plethora of string lights in daughters dorm room! These were perfect and had plenty to share with all the roommates as well!<br \/><br \/>A few extra clips is a good thing- Threading cord thru the \u201cplastic luge or S curve\u201d (see photo for up close design) may break x1-2 but, no worries.. you have more then plenty as back up! And in photos notice the sizing- you\u2019ll see these a bit bigger then many cord clips- the perk with this is.. you\u2019ll need less vs. more to hold a strand as you can space these apart a little bit further and they hold a bit more weight.<br \/><br \/>Although this set DOES include adhesive tape for every clip- if you notice in photo I attached, clips come naked and tape must be attached to each one individually prior to hanging. Not a dealbreaker or hard to assemble but, just more time consuming for the overall project. At a price of almost x10 clips for $1.00- that is a bargain deal and buyer doing some of the assembly must be a way to keep the cost down!?<br \/><br \/>Once in place, we\u2019ve had zero issue with breakage or detachment.. I\u2019m hoping when readying to remove they\u2019ll do so without incident..??!! Zero instructions included nor, any included on package itself! In fact, Photo I included shows zero info in English.. So, I suggest doing a test strip or, not adhering to any painted walls!

The downloads were amazingly quick (using my wireless home network). I have to say the books appeared on my Kindle instantaneously.<br \/><br \/>As soon as I received my Kindle, I charged the battery using a USB port. A full charge from out of the box took 90 minutes.<br \/><br \/>I am so impressed with this product. Speaking as a college professor, I never thought I would want to own an e-reader.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Pave Diamonds Surrounding Natural Amethyst Set Off Purple Gemstone to Perfection","text":"[[VIDEOID:19e815c5c649e82b7b66dff54aa240e0]]Amethyst is the February birthstone, and this STERLING SILVER AMETHYST DIAMOND PENDANT NECKLACE will make a wonderful gift for any female with a February birthday.  I think that the actual pendant is even more lovely than its photos here suggest.  The pave diamonds on the locket bail (the part that holds the pendant on the chain) and the pave diamonds surrounding the natural amethyst set off the large purple gemstone to perfection.  I've never seen a prettier setting for an amethyst.<br \/><br \/>Amethyst colors can vary.  The stone in my necklace is perhaps a little lighter in color than the stone in the product page photos.  However, amethyst can be a bit of a chameleon, and the stone in my pendant is no exception.  It looks darker or lighter, depending on the surrounding level of light.<br \/><br \/>I love the detail in the sterling silver setting.  It has curlicues on the sides and a stylized flower (or four-leaf clover?) on the back.  The chain is 18\" long (fairly short), but is the perfect length to display this delicate piece of jewelry.  The silver chain has a lobster claw safety clasp to hold the necklace securely.<br \/><br \/>The pendant necklace comes in a pretty black Amazon presentation box.  Or, more precisely, presentation boxes.  The first box--lined with bright blue paper--has a drop-down side that reveals an inner box.  The inner box is a black, hinged, traditional jewelry presentation box with a bright blue ribbon opening tab.  Inside that box, the necklace is displayed on a blue-ribbon-tabbed card that is covered with faux velveteen. Opening this gift box is a memorable experience.<br \/><br \/>Because of the chain length, the pendant looks best on a dress or top with a simple collar or no collar.  The pendant itself is so elegant, it will go with anything. (Even a cotton turtleneck, as shown in the accompanying video slide show.)"}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"A Pillow, Not Really an Adjustable Tablet Stand","text":"The LAP PRO universal tablet stand doesn't work very well with my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" Wi-Fi tablet.  The stand consists of a very firm, 18-inch wide, cylindrical pillow with a soft handle that doubles as a sort of tray for the tablet.  Because there is no frame to hold the tablet securely, the tablet must be set carefully into the handle-tray, and then the tablet simply leans against the pillow for support.  However, the tablet is very easily dislodged from the tray, even when the stand is sitting on a flat tabletop.<br \/><br \/>Out of the box, the LAP PRO holds the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet at a near-vertical angle that is uncomfortable for viewing or for using a stylus on the touch screen.  There is a sheet packed with the pillow that says: \"Your LAP PRO has come slightly over filled intentionally, which may interfere with some functions.  This will change in time.  This is to ensure it will perform properly and last longer after it breaks in.  The fabric will stretch and the beans settle from use.\"  However, this is not really a beanbag stand.  The pillow is filled with something that feels like medium-fine sand (not beans).  Also, the pillow is too firm to accommodate its shape to an uneven surface the way a beanbag does.<br \/><br \/>To adjust the tablet viewing angle, you must reshape the pillow--it isn't enough to simply roll the pillow forward or backwards.  Because the pillow is so firm, you must exert some effort in reshaping.  It is easier to adjust the pillow shape and the viewing angle if you unzip the zipper that runs alongside the handle-tray, but then the pillow kind of flops around.  (The zipper is there to open and close a compartment that is probably intended to hold your tablet, because the LAP PRO is also supposed to be a \"caddy\".)<br \/><br \/>If I needed a travel pillow (another of the LAP PRO's advertised uses) or a tablet caddy, I might end up liking the LAP PRO.  However, because the stand is too large for convenient tabletop use, is hard to adjust, doesn't hold the tablet securely, and needs break-in time, I rate it at 2 stars (\"I don't like it\" on the official Amazon scale).<br \/><br \/>EDITED 11\/18\/12:  After hearing from the seller, Renegade Concepts, I believe that I may have received an overfilled LAP PRO.  (Renegade Concepts offered to replace my unit.) If my LAP PRO had been less firm out of the box, I would have rated it at 3 stars (\"It's OK\")."}

The sticker isn\u2019t packaged at all. Just cut vinyl on contact paper. You\u2019ll have to apply the sticker yourself, which is fine.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A high-quality 60% keyboard","text":"This is a 60% keyboard, meaning it doesn\u2019t have a dedicated numpad, arrow keys, or home keys. Assuming you can live without those keys, read on.<br \/><br \/>The first thing you'll notice is the build quality. It feels really solid and well-made. There is no flex in the keyboard, and it is made from Series 5000 aircraft grade aluminum alloy (whatever that means).<br \/><br \/>The OptiPoint switches in the Apex 9 Mini were custom-made by SteelSeries. They are optical switches, which means it uses light to detect when a key has been pressed; optical switches have a quicker reaction time (important for gaming) than traditional mechanical switches.<br \/><br \/>The OptiPoint switches are linear switches rated for 100 million keypresses. They don't require much force to attenuate, and the sound is pretty nice. SteelSeries says the switches are hot-swappable (meaning you can put your own switches into the keyboard), but the keyboard will only work with SteelSeries switches, NOT traditional mechanical switches. This is a big bummer.<br \/><br \/>They keycaps are double-shot PBT, which ensures the legend won't fade over time. Additionally, it also allows for light to shine through, which I appreciate. SteelSeries also has software you can use to customize the backlight colors, etc. if you are into that.<br \/><br \/>Overall, if you're looking for a well-made 60% keyboard, this is a good option! I don't love that the switches aren't truly hot-swappable, but otherwise, this is a good option!"}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"You might find a camera with better recording.","text":"I wished this camera did not pushed the envelope in the 30x optical zoom.  We tested this and on play back the picture was very granular and shaky.  I mean really shaky.  You will need a tripod to reduce the shaking effect.  We compared the output with one of panasonic camera that also had a movie function and we found that was better than this HD camcorder (for about the same price).<br \/><br \/>However, the zoom button was not hyper sensitive and hence you could zoom in and out without the picture looking like you were traveling through the stargate (sorry, for the syfy fans).  It was a very easy and light camera to use and the menu was not overtly complicated in that within one choice you do not have to go into many steps to get what you are looking for - in fact there are only 6 menu options and within each one there is up to 6 choices.  Great ones that we found actually worked included the face chaser (useful for filming moving objects coming towards you!) and the noise reduction (reduced the wind muffles).  The camera is on as soon as you open the side wing with the view - there is no longer a viewer for the eye (thank goodness).<br \/><br \/>Works great with good lighting - natural and artificial.  But does not work too well with dimly lit rooms.  We noticed that it really picks up the sound real well so try not to talk as you are filming as we found we ended up being more focused on that than watching the movie.  The down side on this camera was that you needed to buy a memory card and a big one at that as there is no hard drive with this camcorder; what is available only allows no more than 5 minutes of movies.<br \/><br \/>The camera is okay, not  great as you can get better pictures on a stand alone camera.  There is flash light, which some camcorders do not have. More useful as a camcorder than a camera - so a tad expense for just a camcorder without a hard drive."}

So, when HE named this one the best in this price point I took his advice and I\u2019m thrilled I did!!<br \/><br \/>As one with zero tech skills- I needed \u201cguru advice\u201d about things I didn\u2019t realize or understand.

Hack: we doubled side taped a sleeve to under side of projector- where safe and easy to locate always! 2 Hack: depending on where you\u2019ll use who knows how close to power source you are.. you\u2019ll want to get extension cord to keep with projector.. keep with equipment to avoid any disappointment or avoidable obstacles!!<br \/><br \/>Blue tooth is the bomb!! If projector\/Bluetooth  is turned on- it will try to auto sync by invitation- if you follow prompts to do so on device.. it will hold your hand the whole way! Funny to see ME type these things.. but, trust me.. if I can make it thru the process you can x1000!!! Note: we didn\u2019t use an extra speaker with our movie bc, x3 of us could hear just fine from projector alone.. you receive sound out both sides it seems- NICE!! My son played PS4 games using projector and crazy- I had to tell him to turn down volume..

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Long Term Life is Questionable; Seagate not good quality drives now","text":"The first one of these I got was DOA, but Seagate replaced it quickly for me at no charge, other than my cost to ship it back to them.  Seagate gives a 2-year warranty on their products and from what I understand that's because the expected life of their drives is only two years.  I have had too many failures with Seagate drives, although a drive from any manufacturer can fail and I have had other manufacturer's drives fail too.  I think my inclination now is not to buy Seagate any more.  There are better brands out there, but the bargain priced drives in any brand are usually the cheaper, less reliable ones.  You get what you pay for.  Just be aware that anything you put on a drive from ANY manufacturer should be regularly backed up in another location.

My husband is a programmer and is very knowledgeable regarding computers and technology. He found that this was a bit more complicated than it was implied. Plus, he believes that it would be difficult for someone to install and set up if they don't have a good understanding about computer networking and IP addresses. He called tech support to find out why it wasn't working the first time and was told that it sometimes does that depending on the computer. The other method required using an Ethernet cable which he was able to do without the tech support. Once it was properly set up, it works well.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Nice Emergency Radio; AM radio reception seemed poor; FM was okay","text":"I got this to compare it with the upgraded Greatone emergency radio.  The two models are similar, with the main difference being that this version has fewer features.  This is somewhat more compact than the upgraded model but still has good features.  I couldn't get good reception on it from one of the strongest AM stations in my area.  FM seemed to come in much clearer.  I found one clear WB (weather band) station.  I wouldn't expect top quality sound, as the radio is quite small and compact.  As an emergency radio, this is excellent.  You can charge it with a manual crank, although it takes a LOT of cranking (no different than most radios that charge this way); a solar panel (which I haven't tried yet) or you can charge it from a USB connection. The USB cable is included for that.  If the internal lithium ION rechargeable battery should happen to become discharged before you can get it charged again, you are out of luck, until you can recharge it one of the 3 ways available.  The upgraded version has conventional battery backup, which is better.  On this version, if the rechargeable battery ever dies completely, there is a door with a screw that you can remove to access and replace the battery.  (It should last a very long time and not need replacement.)  Other features:  has an external charging port for a USB device (such as your cellphone) and a light on the end, controlled with a push button switch.  The on\/off, volume knob turned easily, but the tuning knob was a little hard to turn.  If conventional battery backup is not important to you, this radio compares favorably to the upgraded version."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great SLR camera for the money","text":"Ok, so let me preface this by saying that when I was in my 20's I owned a great SLR camera and dragged it around with me everywhere. I even used to take a load of pictures at rock concerts, had interchangeable lenses, a variety of lenses... well, you get the 'picture'. I was a 'professional' amateur. Flash ahead to the 1990's and on, I have a family and start to look for new gadgets. I owned several point and click cameras over the past 20 years, concentrating mainly on small sizes and portability. I loved the fact that I could slip these cameras into my pockebook and pack up the kids to the park (without a huge camera bag). Unfortunately, the pictures were 'ok' but nothing like the quality I had when I owned the old fashioned SLR. Well, now that I am 50'ish and my kids are grown and gone, I figured I would treat myself to a new camera, in particular this Canon Rebel. All I can say is 'wow'! I love it, love it, love it. Having owned it for over a year now (bought it on Amazon but just never got around to writing a review), I have purchased several interchangeable lenses and even a separate flash (although it comes with it's own built in one, I prefer to control the flash myself). The Canon Rebel gives me the quality of the pictures I was used to and with the stabilization, my pictures come out clear and focused every time. I have even started going back to concerts (ok, so they are the same artists I was following when I was much younger) and I am feeling like a pro again. I have also gotten into wildlife and nature pictures and some of the pictures I have taken of flowers could match up with any professional photographer. If you are in the market for a compact SLR, this is the camera to buy!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Bluetooth Keyboard Case Works Flawlessly, Adds Minimal Weight\/Bulk","text":"The LOGITECH SOLAR KEYBOARD FOLIO is easily the best of the three Bluetooth keyboard products that I've tested.  (The others are the [[ASIN:B004YIZXEC iHome Bluetooth Keyboard for iPad 1 and 2 and iPhone (IH-IP2101)]] (no case, about $40), and the [[ASIN:B007C0Y8NQ Targus Versavu Keyboard Case for the New iPad (3rd Gen), Wi-Fi \/ 4G  Model 16GB, 32GB, 64GB THZ17101US  (Black)]] (padded case, about $70).)  Setting up the FOLIO is a snap:  you slip the iPad into the flexible silicon easel tray, move the easel  to the \"Type\" position, turn on your iPad's Bluetooth, and let the iPad find the Folio's keyboard.<br \/><br \/>The Folio converts your iPad into a \"netbook\" with an almost full-sized keyboard.  The keyboard is virtually noiseless, has a pleasant, soft \"touch\" for typing, has the usual specialized function keys (including a volume key), and is big enough to easily accommodate my large hands.  The easel has two comfortable viewing positions, one for typing and one for media viewing.  The Folio offers full scratch and screen protection for the iPad, as both the front and back of the iPad are covered.  The Folio is extremely slim and lightweight-- good points, in my view--but there is NO padding to protect your iPad from jarring or other mishaps.  Whenever you like, you can easily remove your iPad from the Folio's silicon easel tray.<br \/><br \/>The Folio's Bluetooth keyboard is powered by the solar cells on the front of the case.  To fully charge the batteries, you place the case face up in a well-lit room for about six hours.  To check whether the batteries are sufficiently charged for keyboard use, you press the \"Battery Status\" button on the side of the Folio.  A LED light will blink once in green if you have an adequate charge, once in red if you don't.  No light means your batteries are dead and must be recharged, using the solar panels.  (At first, I thought that my Folio's batteries weren't charging, because the \"getting started\"  booklet made me expect a steady green LED light when the batteries were adequately charged.  An excellent chart on the Logitech web site, under the question \"What does the LED mean on my tablet keyboard?\",  cleared up my confusion.)<br \/><br \/>Without fail, the Folio turns my iPad 2 on and off when I open and close the case.  (The iPad general setting for \"iPad Cover Lock\/Unlock\" must be set to \"On\".)  When I open the case, the LED light blinks briefly until the iPad finds and connects to the keyboard.  When you turn off Bluetooth to save iPad battery power, your iPad will find the Folio keyboard again without difficulty when you turn Bluetooth back on.  (The Folio only connects when the easel is set to \"Type\" or \"Media Viewing\" position.)<br \/><br \/>The only thing that I don't love about the Folio, is that you have to be quite careful when closing it.  The edge of your iPad must be in front of the little \"roll bar\" at the Folio's spine, or else the cover won't fully close (and a hurried, careless, forceful closing could damage your iPad screen).  Because this lightweight case adds an excellent physical keyboard to my iPad while adding minimal weight and bulk,  I rate it at 5 stars (\"I love it\" on the Amazon scale).  This is the iPad case that I will be using in the future."}

Yet other reviewers loved it. (This, by the way, is what makes horse races!) So I thought I would take a chance.<br \/><br \/>Here is why I am happy with my choice: (1) the viewer seems larger than its dimensions suggest; (2) the camera fits in my shirt pocket; (3) the pics are crisp indoors and out; (4) the on-off button is clearly marked and the shot button is nice and robust. For me, these features are all I need. To be sure, the camera has a few video bells and whistles -- I'll try those one of these days. No rush.<br \/><br \/>A Con: the shot button takes a little getting used to, since it appears to have two stages to it. If you just press and disengage, nothing will happen. It requires a little patience and then it will take the picture. I can live with that idiosyncrasy.<br \/><br \/>Another Con: no internal memory. You must purchase an SD card before you can use the camera. This too I have accepted, because having pics on cards does make it easy to load them into PCs and laptops.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for a simple \"point-and-shoot\" camera that will also perform other tricks if you are of a mind, go for it!"}

I didn't understand why one of my stylus tips kept falling off. Eventually I had to replace the tip and had the same problem. I then unscrewed the tips on my other stylus and found that there was a post inside that was missing on that stylus.  I contacted Tech Matte and even though the pen was out of warranty, since I had just ordered the tips and discovered the issue, they sent a replacement stylus under the warranty of the tips. To me that is amazing customer service."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Absolutely love my new Kindle HD!","text":"I was currently an Ipad 4 user, having owned an Ipad 3 previously as well. I thought I was sold on Apple until till I purchased my nephew a 7\" Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. When he opened the box and began to use it, I was mesmorized with the quality of the picture and the amazing sound. Being that I have been a Prime member for years, I began to consider purchasing one for myself so I could benefit from the free Kindle book loans and streaming videos. I purchased this 4G LTE 8.9\" version on the Kindle Fire HD and after having used it for several days now non-stop, I assure you that the Ipad is going into the closet (or will be made a gift to one of my neices shortly). I could not resist the $49.99 package for 250 mb a month for 12 months along with the $50 credit Amazon was doing as a promotion. Surfing the web is easy, speed is amazing, I am just so happy with my purchase. You honestly can't get a better deal out there. I love the Fire HD!"}
{"rating":2.0,"title":"You Get What You Pay For","text":"So I have mixed feelings-<br \/>Go by the size chart they have, not by the measurements.<br \/>I have the old MacBook Pro (Late 2013 Version) and was going to buy the 14-15 inch because by all other measurements my laptop should fit in that.<br \/>I ordered the 15.4 Inch in the black, and it BARELY fits. So if you have a durable case on it, and don't want to have to spend time getting it inside the case, I recommend upping to the 15.6 inch.<br \/>Now that all said- the material feels very cheap, and there's no real \"shape\" to the case. It looks like there would be almost a frame inside the charger holder as well as the main part of the laptop case and that's simply not the case. The zippers also stick a lot, whether it's full or empty.<br \/>It would be nice to see the \"younger\" color options were available in the larger cases. But, overall it's a good enough case that I won't return it. Just be aware when you spend $20 for a laptop carrying case on Amazon, it's likely that quality will be subpar.<br \/>It will work for what I need it to (which is to keep my tote organized for college classes)-but overall I feel like the quality and structure of the case could be greatly improved."}

The instructions and setup were straight forward and clear so set up went very well. Although I should point out that I am an IT worker.  Setup took literally less than five minutes including plugging in the hardware, setting up WEP protection, configuring... Once up and running, I have been very happy with the speed boost.  My old Linksys B router was more of a bottleneck than I had thought.<br \/><br \/>My hopes and expectations were pretty limited, I just wanted a device that worked. The elegant design was just a plus. Set up in it's vertical orientation, it has a much smaller footprint than the Linksys it is replacing as well as a classier look.<br \/><br \/>Now that wireless routers have become a basic home appliance, perhaps the best feedback to give on this one is to say that it just plain works. With the ease of set up and the reliability I have seen, I would recommend this to anyone (not sure that I would have done the same with my Linksys.) Solid product."}

I will say that it would make a great gift to give the person who seems to have everything as it is clever and definitely a conversation piece. Holiday giving would work especially to be under the tree for the difficult to buy for sure. I would just keep in mind the battery life.

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Poor support","text":"Lenovo warranty service is non functional. When trying to resolve and issue I was presented with an option to purchase a solution. We have a Lenovo G580 laptop with wireless network connection issues. We have been dealing with this issue from time of purchase, about 4 months. The laptop will loose connection and will not be able to connect without shutting off the laptop and then powering back up. When I called for support I was given the latest drivers to update the laptop, this looked like it fixed the problem but not for long. The laptop still had problems with losing connection. When I called again the hardware department stated that the issue was due to the software on the system. This has happened from time of purchase, so I asked if this would still be covered. The answer was no because they did not feel it was a hardware issue and the only way to continue was to purchase a $179 warranty support package or a $89 single case package. With a guaranteed solution to be provided after the purchase.<br \/><br \/>I was not going to go forward with this option because I do not want to pay for something that should be covered. If Lenovo knows the solution and charges customers more to fix a problem that is from the factory then this will be the last time I purchase and Lenovo or IBM equipment.<br \/><br \/>I instead purchased a $14 usb wireless adapter from the local electronics store. After installing this device and using it, instead of the onboard device, I have not had any connection issues. The system is working without any issues. If this is a software issue then it is a \"hardware\" driver software issue that is only supported by Lenovo.<br \/><br \/>I feel that this is just a way for Lenovo to make extra money from the customers who purchase their products."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Best Looking Smartwatch!","text":"The Misfit Phase is definitely one of the better looking smartwatches! My teenage daughter has been wearing this for the past couple of weeks. It has an almost elegant look to it. It looks more like a traditional watch than a fitness smart watch. My daughter did not have any problems pairing it with her iPhone 6s. The app has been very user friendly so far. Prior to this smartwatch, my daughter had a Jawbone Move Up activity tracker that she had difficulties syncing with her iPhone, so after a short while, she gave up and stopped using it. This device has not given her any troubles. As far as durability, the band appears to be a faux leather. There have been no troubles with the strap or buckle. The crystal glass on the face of the piece has been surprisingly sturdy. My daughter is on her school Winter Guard team and she has practice several times a week. She spins and tosses flags and does a lot of dancing. She admitted to me that there were a couple of times where she expected it to crack, but so far it's held up fine. She has it set up to give her phone notifications, but so far, that has not worked. She thinks it might be because she keeps her phone on silent all the time. She is going to keep working on that. I read some of the other reviews on this, and one mentioned that the buttons on it appeared to be upside down. She has the same issue. We thought it might be that we put the watch band on the wrong way, but that didn't fix it. It is still usable, but slightly unnatural. The sleep tracking is pretty accurate as far as her wake up time. If she is reading in bed or playing on her phone, it will sometimes calculate an earlier bed time than she actually had. Instead of keeping track of steps, it tracks points. She is pretty active, so she set hers with a comparable goal. She likes seeing the pie chart that shows how close she is to her daily goal."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"fitbit 3 stretch bracelet","text":"UPDATE BELOW....I was looking for an easy on easy off choice that wasn't cutting off my circulation. I have a very average wrist - but every one of the stretch type bracelets I've tried before has been too snug.  Opted for the larger size option and it's perfect.  Firmly fits, but not cutting off circulation.  I chose the white.  It's pretty without being obnoxious sparkly.  The side clips (that attach to the fitbit) are secure.  Now.  We'll see how long it lasts.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.<br \/>UPDATE: I still like the bands convenience - on and off - after wearing for just a few weeks - the material is now dull and snaggy. Eh. Its because of the satin material. I wish the material would have held up. I am going to try one of the prints - hopefully they are NOT a satin material."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"DO NOT REMOVE home button plastic cover; case is excellent but instructions do not list this issue","text":"I just ordered this for my 7th generation iPad and the case itself appears to be almost indestructible. In fact it is so well put together that it takes about 30 minutes just to install it with the iPad.<br \/><br \/>INSTALLATION<br \/>- Pull the stand off the case.<br \/><br \/>- Remove the silicone outer rim from the cover. I found removing the silicone rim hard to figure out until I took my fingernail\u00a0to peel if off the track that goes around the entire top of the case. It gets peeled off from the outermost edge.<br \/><br \/>- Unhinge the miniscule snaps (by the arrows) located around the case in order to open it. Once again, my stubby fingernails came in handy. It is only then that the iPad can be inserted.<br \/><br \/>- Insert the iPad into the open case. Make sure it is facing correctly based on the orientation of the case.<br \/><br \/>- DO NOT remove the plastic film covering the home button that is on the clear plastic case top. I did not know this and removed it and it damaged the cover with glue (see photos).  It removed cleanly on all but one side where tremendous glue residue was left behind. The plastic film was partially up before I even began pulling it off and is typical of the type film I see covering watch faces, etc. so naturally I removed it as there was no mention not to in the manual.<br \/><br \/>- Re-fasten the top and \"snap\" it into place.<br \/><br \/>- Re-attach the silicone rim. Make sure that the rim once again is pulled up and over the top of the case and that the silicone edge is pushed into the track around the case. If it is not seated in the track, the case will not be sealed correctly.<br \/><br \/>With regard to the large smear of glue residue left behind by the thin plastic film that covered the home button. I contacted support to find out what can be used to remove this residue but there was nothing they could recommend with the iPad inside. They did say possibly hand sanitizer because it had alcohol in it but that should not touch the iPad. A damp rag did not work nor did a rag with water. This is extremely upsetting to me because it mars an otherwise nice looking case. However, they are sending me a replacement case with a possible return label for the \"new\" damaged case. I will update my review after I receive the new case.<br \/><br \/>The stand is detachable and has two heights that can be used in four positions. What this means is that the low stand can be used with the iPad in the portrait or landscape postion. The stand can then be reversed for standing up the iPad in\u00a0the portrait or landscape postion. I personally only like the landscape position for either height as it feels like the iPad is going to fall using in portrait mode.<br \/><br \/>Also note that the stand is not easy to just snap on and off of the case if one is storing it there. It takes a little bit of effort and time. Although, it can be snapped on the case for portability, I have chosen not to do this because of this difficulty. Instead I just choose to lay the stand on top of the iPad so it is easily put into service.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this is an excellent case that offers superb protection for the iPad. The case is extremely heavy. It is almost like carrying a laptop around from the olden days. I love the low stand angle with the iPad in the landscape position; in fact, that is the only way I like the stand. This postion is perfect for typing on the iPad as if one is typing on a keyboard.\u00a0 I am, however, very upset about the glue left behind from the plastic circle strip that covered the home button which I should not have removed but which was not mentioned in the manual. Had my cover not been destroyed by this glue, I would have rated this 4 stars. If there was no glue residue and the stand was part of the cover and was not so heavy, I would have rated this 5 stars.  I personally prefer a stand that is attached to the case. This requires setup each time as a separate piece.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: I updated my review above regarding the home button sticker I pulled off. Otter box said it was not supposed to get removed because it is a fully enclosed system. I asked them to update their documentation to say this so others do not make the same mistake I did. I will post another update after my new case arrives and perhaps update this review to 4 stars if it is satisfactory.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 2\/29\/20 - I finally got my replacement Otter Box and it is working fine. I now know not to remove that plastic film over the Home Button even if it looks like it is falling off or should come off."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Versatile for Phone\/ DSLR Camera","text":"UPDATED: Earlier Review: \"Right out of the box to test use with my Android and Camera. The Android is a Galaxy J7 Crown and on that phone I had put an outer casing to protect it (since the phone on its own is very thin). The Clamp for use with a phone was able to fit snugly over both, but it was very tight. I've since been contacted Ubeesize , voluntarily without my having contacted them, that they can provide a large clamp for the phone due to the phone casing. . Then tried seeing how it would work with a Canon T3i DLSR camera . As can be seen in the images , success! The portion that attaches to the bottom of camera has a nice little 'knob' for screwing in quite tightly (as does the mount for screwing the camera on). These little knobs could be easily missed. In other words,  all fit on 'Tight' in all ways and the legs are very flexible. Will be interested to see all this will come down out in the field, but inside, for common use so far, great. Only thing, I'm afraid I could lose the removable part (detachable base),  as it is very small (Make a mental note).\" UPDATE: A new , larger mount is available that swivels from 'Landscape' to \"Portrait' position without having to remove the camera mount, as it previously was. Would highly recommend this 'improved mount' , also pictured."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Makes It Super Easy to Extract, Back Up, Share Photos Stored on Mobile Devices","text":"IBI - THE SMART PHOTO MANAGER (US Version) makes it super easy to extract, back up, and share photos stored on my mobile devices.  Instead of emailing cell phone photos that I want to share among electronic devices (an iPad Air (3rd Gen), a desktop PC, and a Samsung Galaxy cell phone), I can upload the photos to Ibi via a network connection with only a couple of clicks in the Ibi app.<br \/><br \/>No longer do I have to address an email, select and add the photos, send the email--and then reverse the process on a second device (open the email, download the photos, and save the photos to the device).  All that\u2019s necessary is to take the photos, open the Ibi app, choose \u201cimport photos\u201d, select the photos, and hit the import button.<br \/><br \/>The photos are immediately uploaded to Ibi, and I can access them immediately on all of my other devices.  There is no need to clutter up email or to consume precious storage space on my mobile devices, when all I want to do is share photos.<br \/><br \/>Ibi is extremely versatile.  It allows you to sort and organize photos, and create Albums.  It allows you to authorize certain people to email photos directly to Ibi.  It allows you to set up different areas of Ibi for the use of individuals.  It allows you to upload its contents to a PC or other even larger storage device by plugging in a USB cable (not included).  It even allows you to stream your videos to a television set (using Chromecast or Roku apps).<br \/><br \/>Ibi is easy to set up, using Bluetooth.  My iPad and my Galaxy phone both found the powered on (plugged in) Ibi in less than 30 seconds.  Once set up, Ibi communicates via your home network\u2019s Internet access.  When your Ibi app is set up, click on Help, and download the complete user manual (a PDF file).  The manual is easy to understand, and will enable you to get the most out of your Ibi.<br \/><br \/>Ibi is a small drive that easily fits on a bookshelf.  It uses just one power cord.  I really love this Ibi storage drive.  It is simplifying my life.<br \/><br \/>+++++IMPORTANT NOTE: You should NOT choose \u201cautomatic backup\u201d in the Ibi app Settings until you understand how the app works.  With automatic backup enabled, Ibi will copy all of the photos stored on EACH mobile device, and you will probably get a lot of duplicate photos.  For example, if you have been sharing and storing the same photos on an iPad and a cell phone, Ibi will copy the photos from each device.  Worse, if you go into Ibi and delete the duplicates, Ibi will keep automatically adding the photos back as long as the photos still exist in storage on the two different devices.<br \/><br \/>You will probably want to use \u201cautomatic backup\u201d when you first set up your Ibi.  That way all of your photos will be automatically copied to Ibi to start you off.  But you should turn \u201cautomatic backup\u201d off before you start deleting duplicate photos.  You will never have a problem with duplicate photos if automatic backup is turned off.+++++"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Improvements over older versions of Tom Tom; nice large screen","text":"You might think that with GPS on most cell phones these days you wouldn't need a standalone GPS, but this can still be very handy for navigation and gives you extras you don't get with a cell phone.  If you are making a long trip or driving in unfamiliar places, this is what you want.  The screen is nice and large; bigger than a typical cell phone screen.  If you have an older vehicle that doesn't have a Bluetooth connection to your cell phone, this Tom Tom has a feature to link to your phone so that you can talk on your phone through the Tom Tom; it is easy to set up and works well.  There is also a \"find my car\" feature, if you forget where you parked.  I haven't tested that yet, but it could come in handy.  This unit also contains walking directions, so that if you are trying to go somewhere on foot in an area you are not familiar with, the unit will guide you.  Some of the older Tom Toms had that feature; some did not.  If you have previously owned a Tom Tom, you will find the interface slightly different, but not complicated to figure out.  If you haven't had a Tom Tom before, you might manage to learn how to use the unit quicker than someone who has owned a previous model.  One thing that always bugged me with Tom Tom (and it is still in this version); you enter addresses backwards; you put in city and state first; then street name and direction and then street number last.  It works from the broadest part of the address down to the narrowest.  There are several pluses of this GPS over just a cell phone application, but I haven't had time to check them all out, such as real time traffic reports.  Also, if you plan to drive at all in Europe, Tom Tom seems to have better maps for Europe than other GPS competitors.  I don't know if this unit comes with world maps or just U.S. maps.  As far as accuracy, the device was off by about 1\/2 block on my first destination.  It said that I had reached there, but wasn't quite there yet.  It's close enough so that most of the time you should be fine and maybe some destinations are harder to pinpoint than others.  I don't think you will be disappointed at all with this unit.  There is no power cord adapter, so you have to charge it through USB or in your car with the included adapter.  The older Tom Tom units had power plugs included for various countries (about 6 different ones I think).  With USB everywhere, I guess the need for an A\/C adapter is not as important as it once was.  Almost a 5-star unit, but not quite there."}

Has the AA01 panel:<br \/><br \/>PROS:  Very good HD picture, which becomes stunning with good source material (after calibrating the picture); excellent SD picture (better than the good CRT TV it replaced); tons of controls for picture calibration; streaming Netflix is great, the Pandora app has become my household's new source for music of all types, either through the TV speakers or piped to the stereo; ethernet makes upgrading firmware and internet apps very easy; lots of connectivity; easy to set up; light; swivel stand works well; power efficient; doesn't get hot; no noise or buzz; no dead or stuck pixels; has analog audio out jack (important for old A\/V receivers); functions as an outstanding computer monitor (with DVI-to-HDMI cable); glossy screen helps picture and repels dust; can't even notice the red \"Touch of Color\" design.<br \/><br \/>CONS:  Though black levels are generally very good, when the screen and room are both dark you can see some flashlighting around the corners and some bleedthrough of the backlight; very fast motion on screen will cause brief pixelization and loss of picture clarity (has to be very fast motion -- football and other sports look great); picture quality degrades quickly as you move off-center (though not as much as in some other LCD TVs); requires major picture calibration out of the box (I used settings found in reviews of this TV on the web, tweaked them a bit to preference, and the picture's much better, though it's hard to get it right); most of the current internet apps are useless; the factory preset modes are useless.<br \/><br \/>Overall it's a very good TV, with a picture that can sometimes be mesmerizing.  And I'm glad I paid a bit extra for the C650's internet connectivity and glossy screen.  But my main complaints - backlight bleedthrough, motion pixelization and off-center picture quality - lead me to believe that my next TV might be a plasma.  Sound is adequate, neither a pro or con really.  Four stars."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"It's a READER, not really a tablet","text":"Listen, for the price, it's good.  It's a reader, not really a tablet, but Amazon sort of marketed it to compete as a tablet.  As a reader, it's exceptional.  As a tablet it needs some work. Be prepared... there are glitches, app failures, files that cannot be loaded or used, no external volume control, once you put in in a \"cover\/holder\" it is difficult to use the controls, you cannot delete files you have looked at without removing all and even though I SHOULD be able to access my paid Dishnet online account to play movies, I cannot on the fire because it will not accept a tiny video enhancement file. Further, I get a lot of \"connection error\" tabs when accessing the web or app store and more recently, it just freezes up.  The only remedy at that point is to push and hold the power button.<br \/>I just heard they have a new version next Spring and they are supposedly working on software upgrades for the current release. It would be nice to have a camera so that you could Skype.  On the \"up side\"?  I watched a free video (provided via \"Prime\" subscription.  The video was flawless. Some \"apps\" are great and work well... about 1\/2 do not.... I'm a glass 1\/2 full kinda gal, so I consider this on the \"up side.\"  Some have complained saying it is too easy to turn off the kindle fire... I don't find this to be an issue.<br \/>I've updated my review to say that as a reader, the Fire rocks.  As a tablet, you probably want something more reliable and solid."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A good compact stereo bluetooth speaker","text":"I own the A3143 Premium Stereo Bluetooth speaker (2x10W=20W) which sounds great, but it doesn't have a microphone or the longer battery life of this lower-cost A3102 SoundCore speaker (2x3W=6W).  The features and sound characteristics are different, but which is the better choice depends on personal preference.  To me based on sound quality alone, the A3143 wins hands down. The bass is stronger (more power is required to drive the lower frequencies than the higher frequencies), but I also find overall frequency response to be more balanced and accurate for instruments and vocals. For either speaker, I'd recommend using an EQ app to set the frequency response and spatial effects to your preference (I use Bass EQ from Coocent).  Interestingly, the maximum volume level for both the A3143 and this A3102 SoundCore are about the same.<br \/><br \/>The A3102 has a brighter sound overall.  The A3102 is good as a general purpose speaker, and it is excellent to use with a cell phone.  The A3102 microphone (which the A3143 doesn't have) and speaker quality for voice calling are crisp and clear.  My dad who can't hear very well often could not understand me on my cell phone handset or its speakerphone, but had no problem when I used the A3102.<br \/><br \/>So for long battery life, good overall music speaker, and particularly for use as a microphone\/speakerphone for voice calls, A3102 is a good choice.  For best music reproduction, the A3143.  For either, Anker's quality and customer support are among the best in the industry."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"4 Stars because of the size!! Easy set up.","text":"This tablet is a great concept for having small tablets. I really enjoy the peace of mind that if the grandkids want to watch a movie on this, it has safe search settings for them to use. And if they are eating or drinking, more then likely they will be spilling something or leaving wonderfully adorable fingerprints all over this. So with it being water \u2018resistent\u2019, I am not to concerned about cleaning it afterwards. The battery life appears to be holding up quiet well. I have not used an android device very much but the \u201cOk Google\u201d to start the voice activation is REALLY awesome!! Makes searching for recipes, music, videos, books or anything else online really convenient!!<br \/><br \/>Once you sign into a google account, the device pretty much sets itself up without much hassle of having to create multiple new logins for different companies.<br \/><br \/>The expandable memory slot is a really nice addition for adding a micro-SD, ive noticed they have dropped the prices on those so its very simple to make room or add media from a main computer.<br \/><br \/>Cons: (so far)<br \/>A downside to this, because of the size, the screen resolution is a bit odd. And when looking at high resolution images, they still appear somewhat grainy.<br \/><br \/>I think overall, for the price of this tablet, its an incredible deal, especially if you have kids that are starting to get on the internet, the kids safe option is a serious peace of mind at least for my family!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Problem Solver","text":"If you live in a rural area where your only option is satellite internet, this gadget is exactly what you need. Instead of paying an arm and a leg for what is basically glorified dial-up, you can have decent speed at a fraction of the cost. You just need a SIM card from your provider for this to work. If you have spotty coverage, you can look into getting an antenna that boosts the signal in your home. There are good kits available now. Keep in mind that this particular device only works with AT&T and T-mobile. I HIGHLY recommend this device for everyone who is sick of satellite internet.<br \/><br \/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great Sound, Simple, Elegant Design and Functions","text":"This is an elegantly simple Bluetooth speaker. The contols are very basic on the device itself, a large central volume dial, Power, Group (for grouping multiple speakers to the same source, Bluetooth and next (for very basic functionality of skipping songs in Spotify etc.) Even the compact square shape is elegant simplicity.  This is not a whistles and bells device. It's one differentiating function is the ability to group multiple Izzy's to the same source which for me isn't something I'm really looking for.<br \/><br \/>What I am looking for is a good solid sound in a Bluetooth speaker, that can fill a living room when I bring a projector home to play movies for the kids, and a speaker that can fill the room with music while I work.  This speaker does both quite well.  The sound is great, and there is not much distortion through the range, although I found it better matched to softer music over harder rock.  I found the fidelity was much truer in the quieter ranges.<br \/><br \/>Bluetooth pairing was as easy and quick as any device I have ever owned.  The simple functionality makes it simple to use right out of the box, and I am very happy with the sound.  I love this little speaker."}

Connected to a USB 2.0 port on an older desktop PC, it\u2019s slightly faster than a darned good internal TP-Link adapter.  Connected to a USB 3.0 port on that same PC, it\u2019s about 25 Mbps faster, delivering downloads at an average 225+ Mbps.  (Comcast delivers very high Internet speeds on the adapters\u2019 second bands, where there is far less Internet traffic.)<br \/><br \/>A nice thing about this adapter is that you can move it around, and aim it, so that it picks up the very best wi-fi signal from your router.  It comes with the option of installing a software package for managing the adapter, or installing a standalone driver if you want to continue using a different connection manager.  If you install the software package, you get an easy-to-use Genie program that tells you whether the adapter is connected, what its MAC number is, etc.<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m a major fan of Netgear products (routers and adapters).  In my experience, Netgear products deliver as advertised, are stable and trouble-free, and last for years."}

Second, the sound is good, bass is phenomenal, so the discerning headphone user will not be disappointed with the quality of the Moshi Vortex. I found these to still be a little large for my ears, at least weight wise, and I am not comfortable when walking with them in (they are fine if I am sitting in my house listening to music, just not wearing them around in my ears when up and active). I am rating them 4 stars simply because I think the sound quality is excellent, but I think you can do better for your $80 cost in getting a better fitting, lighter pair to be used on the go (as I do when I exercise\/walk every morning)."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Practically impossible setup; video \/ pictures are distorted and concave, and camera is SUPER CREEPY","text":"I spent 12+ hours over several days on setup, testing, and investigation and cannot recommend this camera in its current state due mostly to setup difficulty. If I were not tenacious, I would have thrown this in the garbage and given up. I still have not gotten everything to work, but after reading the other reviews several times and Internet research, I was able to get almost everything working as I wanted it.<br \/><br \/>Once I got this working, the images were pretty good (but distorted) as long as the software was setup up to record in high definition.  Below are the PROS and CONS and my experiences during setup.<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/><br \/>- The camera is small and except for the lights, unnoticeable.<br \/><br \/>- It comes with mounting screws in case one wants to secure the metal base. However, double-stick tape is provided to mount the metal plate without using the screws.  Since the camera base is magnetic, there may be no need to mount any plate as it can be placed on the fridge, pet playpen, or anything that is metal.<br \/><br \/>- Once the high definition is selected, the picture is pretty good even if slightly distorted. Any other setting except for high definition results in a grainy image.<br \/><br \/>- The camera stores the images on the SD card which is visible through the cloud.  I used a [[ASIN:B013CP5IWO SanDisk Extreme 64GB MicroSDXC UHS-1 Card with Adapter (SDSQXNE-064G-GN6MA)]] in the camera.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/><br \/>- The camera is unusable unless cloud setup is done and the SD card is initialized. This means that besides a wireless network and SD card, a Smartphone or tablet is needed to download the EZVIZ app.<br \/><br \/>- The setup can be an absolute NIGHTMARE. For some people, things just work. However, for others like me, it takes lots of effort and guesswork to set up the software.<br \/><br \/>- No images are available in the cloud even after cloud setup. When I took the camera offline after hours worth of recording, I was not able to view any stored images. Therefore, the comment that there is cloud storage after setup appears to be untrue based on my results.  When trying to play a video, I got the message &#34;Video playback failed, error code:340405.&#34;<br \/><br \/>- Although I could remove the SD card from the camera and see a list of MP4 and PICT files on my computer, I was unable to view any of them. I tried on both Windows 10 and Windows 7 laptops without success. For the MP4 files, I tried Windows Media Player, IE, Audacity, Movie Maker, and QuickTime. With media player I got the error: &#34;Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support the file type or might not support the codec that was used to compress the file.&#34; With QuickTime (which is supposed to be able to read MP4 on a file open), I got an &#34;Error -2048: Couldn't open the file hiv00084.mp4 because it is not a file that QuickTime understands.&#34; Since PICT is a Macintosh picture image, for those files I downloaded a trial version of Adobe Photoshop. When opening the PICT files, I got the error message &#34;Adobe PhotoShop CC 2015. Could not complete the request because it is not the right kind of document.&#34; The files that get created on the SD card and which I should be able to open but cannot on a laptop are as follows:<br \/><br \/>hiv00000.mp4<br \/>hiv00000.pict<br \/>hiv00001.mp4<br \/>hiv00001.pict<br \/>....<br \/><br \/>- The images \/ videos taken are concave even in high-definition. It was as if I was looking through a drinking glass to view the images.  I assume this may be typical of many cameras, but I cannot be sure. My dashcam images are not distorted like this. The first image I attached via a screen capture demonstrates this. This first image was not in high-definition, instead it was using the default resolution.<br \/><br \/>- The nighttime image is useless if the camera is facing glass (window, mirror, etc.) as you can see from the high-definition second image I attached. (PS Ignore the volume control bar as that accidentally came up when I was taking a screen shot with my other tablet.)<br \/><br \/>- The software is quirky. For example, besides not being intuitive, sometimes the software would not auto rotate on my tablet and other times it did.<br \/><br \/>- This camera is SUPER CREEPY. At night, when I turned off the IR light setting, the camera actually took a picture of the inside of my house even though I had it facing out toward my balcony. In certain situations, it must use the window as a reflector to capture the image behind it when the IR light setting is off. The image taken was very visible even though it was almost in X-Ray looking form.  I was really &#34;creeped out&#34; by this.  (The IR light setting says&#34; When disabled, the image remains colorful with more image noise in dark environment.&#34; &#34;When enabled, the image turns black and white with clear image in dark environment.&#34;}. What this is supposed to mean is the image in front of the camera; not behind it.<br \/><br \/>MY SETUP EXPERIENCE<br \/><br \/>Most people do not have to worry about this but since I have MAC address filtering security set on my router, I needed the MAC address of the camera for the router to allow the camera to connect. The MAC address is not in the documentation, but I accidentally found it when I dropped the camera and the camera cover came off. It is written on the main chip below the camera faceplate. Therefore, the steps I took for setup were:<br \/><br \/>- Added the MAC address of the camera into my router's MAC address filtering list.<br \/><br \/>- Inserted the 64GB micro SD card into the tiny slot on the side of the camera as per the instructions.<br \/><br \/>- Plugged in camera.<br \/><br \/>- Downloaded the EZVIZ app from Google Play (since I have an Android device) on my Google Nexus 7 tablet.<br \/><br \/>- Once installed, I opened the app. The screen displayed was nonsensical. There were stick drawings in the center and if I rolled my fingers from left to right it scrolled around the screen. I assume the app was designed for those who understand images with no words. Since I did not, I exited the app and and re-opened it. It was then that I got a different screen that enabled me to start to creating an account.<br \/><br \/>- Once I typed in my email address and password I wanted, I hit finish. The book does not detail what is supposed to be done. It assumes everyone knows.  I got a message that said &#34;Operation failed; failed to get the verification code. (99999).&#34; After trying several times, I quit for the second day in a row. I even wrote the company but they never responded.<br \/><br \/>- The next day I tried again but this time I clicked on the check mark on the keyboard when I was done inputting my email and password and that worked.<br \/><br \/>- I attempted to add my camera after sign-in by clicking on the + sign as directed in the manual. It's at this point that I was asked to log into my network. Even though the network and password was correct, the login failed. I even disabled the MAC address filtering temporarily and tried again. Still no luck. I then wired this directly to the USB port on my router and it still failed with the message  &#34;Operation failed. Please try again. (102000).&#34;  I had enough and quit for the day.<br \/><br \/>- The next day, I re-read the reviews on Amazon. User Leslie mentioned in her review that &#34;the specs for the camera say it works on a 2.4GHz band.&#34;  She said that she set her &#34;phone to only use the 2.4 band and not roam to the 5GHz band.&#34; That made me realize that I had to connect my Google Nexus 7 to the 2.4GHz band and not the 5GHz band. I mistakenly assumed that the camera was picking up my wireless network and trying to connect. It appears that it has to use the band of the phone or tablet to connect. Once I did this, I was able to add the camera by following the remaining directions in the book--scanning the QR code on the camera, etc. etc.<br \/><br \/>- I attempted to complete the rest of the instructions related to setup through device settings but that also was impossible to find. I eventually discovered that by tapping on the &#62; sign next to my camera name (it's the &#62; to the right that you can see in the first picture I attached), I would get to settings. I was looking for a gear icon but that's not how you get to settings in this software. Once I found the settings it was pretty easy to initialize the SD card, change the device password, etc.<br \/><br \/>- The next problem I had was actually seeing more than the image on the screen. In order to set up high definition, you have to click on the image itself. It's at this point that I was able to change the settings to full-screen mode, change from basic, standard, or HD images, take a picture, capture a recording, or turn the sound on or off.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I cannot recommend this camera due to the setup hassles, distorted video, inability to read the files on the SD card without the app, and the difficulty of navigating around the EZVIZ software. Also, the fact that changing one setting displays the contents of a person's house even if the camera is pointing toward a parking lot, is SUPER CREEPY. It also records conversations almost one room away. I unplugged mine and may only plug it in from time to time when I'm out of the house because this concerns me.  Another thing to be wary of is the legal ramifications of recording voice and video; however, that applies to any recording or video capturing device and is not an issue specific to this camera.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE Nov 24, 2015 --&#62; I finally figured out how to access cloud storage when my unit was offline. I clicked on the picture and then clicked on the blue gallery bar at the bottom of the screen.  From there I selected the bar above SD and then was able to pick a date from a calendar. Once I did this, I was presented with a list of pictures to choose from."}

USB 3.0 is backward compatible, so the hub works with both my USB 2.0 and 3.0 thumb drives.<br \/><br \/>It's nice to have 7 ports, because I rarely need more than 4 ports, and having unused ports means there is space to plug in wide USB drives (e.g., an EyeFi card reader).  The ports are tight, so it's harder to plug in a thumb drive than I would like, but that's a quibble.<br \/><br \/>The hub has an attached USB cable, which makes it more suitable for a desktop setup than for travel.  Nevertheless, it's equipped for travel--the power supply is equipped with a &#34;universal plug&#34; that works with all styles of electrical outlets.  It arrives with a standard two-pronged U.S. wall outlet adapter installed, but there are three more adapters for other countries' outlets.

That being said, I always try to be fair, honest and objective in my reviews. That being said, I am a little disappointed in this Sharp system. As the ad specified this was good for small spaces, I set it up in my bedroom (as I have a 32\" Samsung flatscreen there with no additional sound support). Here are the pros: Set up was not difficult (although it did take me close to an hour to do by myself with the instructions). Sound is clear, bass tones are adjustable and I found the overall quality sufficient for a small\/medium sized room. Here are the cons: First, as another reviewer has written, the fan in the bass unit is audible. Make sure you set it somewhere further enough away from where you are sitting or you will be distracted (regardless of how loud you set the speaker) by the hum. The other thing I wish Sharp would have done is make this a wireless device. I think this is why it took me so long to set it up trying to hide\/wind the wires inside the carpeting so as not to be seen. To me, wireless is the way to go particularly with a sound system. I actually had bought another unit for a set up in my den http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B004MME6S4\/ref=wms_ohs_product which is a Panasonic.

The wireless woofer is an asset with no ugly wires (as my previous Panasonic system had)and amazing (loud) bass tones. The sound is amazing (which I expected from Bose). The cons: I am having a difficult time using the remote control which is supposed to act as an all-in-one device (supposedly so I can get rid of all these little dedicated remotes I have for the DVD, television, cable, etc). For whatever reason, the device sticks frequently or doesn't respond to commands and I end up reverting back to the old standby remotes. I am disappointed that a company like Bose couldn't have perfected something like this better. But then I keep thinking, maybe I did something wrong, not sure. The only other con is the price. If this was in a $700-1000 range I would tell you to snatch it up in a heartbeat. But for $1500 you are honestly paying for the name (and the status symbol bragging rights to say you own a Bose system). Wait for the price to come down and grab it.

This has the passable optics for a beginning birder still not looking to invest well.  It is fairly sharp in the center of the image but less so at the edges.  It has a very small depth of field, but a surprising close focus of 6-8 feet. I would not recommend this as a replacement for a full set of bins, but you are getting half a budget pair binoculars.<br \/><br \/>The focus is easy enough to adjust one handed and it seems fairly well constructed in the hand.  I would not want to drop it and fully test it, but it seems sturdy enough. Lense covers are also fine.  The eye cup raises and lowers for eyeglass wearers but the mechanism seems less quality than other aspects of the monocular.  I question the focal length placement for the cup at full or minimum extension.  It seems like the missed the proper marks.<br \/><br \/>I think it will work for what I was hoping for, a rainforest spotting aid and a reserve optics for the car, but not sure I would recommend for much else."}

It has no expansion gussets, so the total capacity is one laptop or one very thick sheaf of documents. Internal zipper compartments are relatively useless if a bag can\u2019t expand to hold the things added to the compartments.<br \/><br \/>Third, the bag is difficult to open.  It opens with two metal clasps--these are hidden beneath the purely decorative buckled front straps.  You have to pull up on both clasps at once to lift the flap, and you can\u2019t do this easily without laying the bag flat on one side, or holding it on your lap.  The leather flap itself is very stiff (at least when the bag is new), and this adds to the opening difficulty.<br \/><br \/>Fourth, the bag has no locking mechanism.  Not that it is easy to open (see previous paragraph).<br \/><br \/>Fifth, the brass fittings must tarnish very easily, because the bag arrives with every single exposed brass piece wrapped tightly in thin plastic wrap.  It takes something very sharp to cut the plastic, and you must be careful not to scratch the fittings.  (I succeeded in removing the wrappings without damaging the bag, but I punctured my left wrist with an Olfa knife in the process.)<br \/><br \/>The bag is reasonably priced (about $90 on Amazon).  It comes with a snap-on shoulder carrying strap, and has a sturdy, permanently attached satchel handle.  The handle is very comfortable.  The bag leather is already distressed, so you needn\u2019t worry about scratches.  This is a truly rugged laptop bag."}

It\u2019s really cool in a unique and tasteful way.<br \/><br \/>The waxed material lends this a military- almost WWII canvas tent vibe- in look and feel- it\u2019s nostalgic and timeless. Leather straps + hardware for buckling just scream equestrian to me- saddle, bridal, stirrup- ha! It\u2019s very classic, feels relaxed but upscale and the combo of the two look blends together really well!! (TBH, anyone with a horse nich\u00e9 I\u2019m sure would love this for just that reason alone..!!)<br \/><br \/>Bag is sized for just to carry the basic business essentials.. although, it appears larger (roomier) than it actually is- it\u2019s not! Realistically this is best for those who tend to carry less vs. more between business\/home.. a laptop and a few files or folders- if needing more room, you may be disappointed. True, this has a few extra pockets cut for the organization of smaller items- but those are sized for cell phones, wallet\/keys, business cards.. not much else!<br \/><br \/>The quality and craftsmanship is 100% there.. this bag has the merit to go the distance- and it\u2019s classic design will keep it in style for years to come! Happy with my choice and I am loving the unique colors and style- hope this info can help your decision.. Happy shopping!"}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"OK, perhaps a little pricey","text":"These are okay Bluetooth headphones.  The sound is passable, although they are in no way cancelling and ambient noise washes out the sound.  road noise on car trips can overwhelm it rather easily at comfortable listening levels.

I'm not the pickiest person when it comes to sound quality and found them to be okay - not great, but acceptable for me. They're comfortable to wear. This style of earbud doesn't annoy me too much. The charging case works well. There is a control button on each one. One thing I did notice is that when I remove one from my ear, the music doesn't stop playing. My kids have different brand ear buds (one has Airpods and the other has Skull Candy wireless) and that is a feature that both of theirs have. Another thing, the wording on the packaging implies that they've got a lot of bass, but I haven't observed that. Overall, they're okay."}
{"rating":2.0,"title":"Videos are grainy & unclear; voice recording is lackluster; instructions are awful","text":"[[VIDEOID:b8f1cbabf90d7d589510f9b1985120d1]] I ordered this camera to do my Vine reviews and am very surprised as how terrible the quality of the video is. Since I can only attach one video to this review, I decided to shoot the LOUIS LUNCH rush in New Haven CT taken while I was seated at the counter. As can be seen, the video is grainy (even at highest resolution), unclear, and  the voice is not great even though the camera was right next to my mouth.<br \/><br \/>I also tested this camera with my video reviews. If the camera is no more than 12 inches from the object or my voice, it takes okay video but any movement turns into a blur. When shooting video from about two feet away, it is almost a complete blur with the voice barely being heard and I was using a tripod.<br \/><br \/>This camera comes with two re-chargeable batteries, a 16GB SD card, a USB cable with AC adapter, absolutely lousy instructions, cables for connecting camera to TV, and a thumb drive with two slots for the SD card. It also comes with a case.<br \/><br \/>The camera has to be charged for at least six hours before use. It is somewhat easy to figure out using the display and menu buttons but it would have been great to have good instructions. The display playback appears to be frame by frame and not full video replay--at least I could not get full video replay. There is a wide angle and telephoto button. The camera is easy to hold and record with and there is a tripod hole. However, I absolutely hate the results and am sorry I ordered this due the substandard quality of the video it produces.<br \/><br \/>I attached 11 pictures as follows.<br \/><br \/>1 - picture list of parts<br \/>2 - photo of specifications<br \/>3 - photo of features<br \/>4 - camera's resolution menu<br \/>5 - camera's frame_rate menu<br \/>6 - camera's  white_balance menu<br \/>7 - camera's  scene  menu<br \/>8 - camera's  setup  menu<br \/>9 - camera's  anti_shake  menu<br \/>10 - camera's  exposure  menu<br \/>11 - camera's ISO menu"}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Clear Sound, But Fumbly Controls, Hard-to-Read Instructions","text":"At the price (about $40 on Amazon), I expected more from these PIONEER ACTIVE IN-EAR WIRELESS HEADPHONES WITH INTEGRATED CLIP (Red SE-CL5BT(R)).  The sound is very clear, which is obviously the most important thing.  However, I find the controls (3 tiny, flat buttons) to be fumbly and difficult to use.  The fact that the buttons have dual functions (e.g., one button increases the volume when pressed once, and advances music to the next track when pressed and held) is partly to blame.  However, the buttons seem slow to respond, so I am constantly pressing and holding when all I want is the press once function.<br \/><br \/>The headphones paired with both my iPad Pro and my Galaxy S7 smartphone, but NOT particularly easily.  To place the headphones in pairing mode, so that your Bluetooth device can see the Pioneer broadcast in the device Settings, you must press and hold the headphones\u2019 center button until a miniscule LED light on the side of the clip blinks alternately red and blue.  (Normally, the light is red when the headphones are charging, and slowly-blinking blue when the headphones are turned on and connected.)<br \/><br \/>What\u2019s hard about that pairing, you may ask?  It\u2019s in the instructions, except that the instructions are printed in type so tiny that even the best eyes will need a magnifying glass to read them.  Worse yet, the key instructions are printed in pale gray (like grayed-out PC menu selections) on soft, recycled paper that is also gray.  Purchasers deserve instructions that are printed in black ink, at the very least.<br \/><br \/>The clip is nice to have.  The battery life isn\u2019t great (about 8 hours), and the battery takes about 2 hours to charge via the included USB cable.  The \u201ccarrying case\u201d for the extra ear tips (you get size S, M, and L sets) is a small resealable plastic bag.  The headphones don\u2019t have \u201cover ear\u201d fit (as stated at least once on the product page), but are strictly \u201cin ear\u201d fit (i.e., battery-powered earbuds).<br \/><br \/>I didn't try using these earphones to answer telephone calls.  However, considering how many mistakes I make with the tiny buttons when playing music, I suspect that I'd be hanging up a lot when I was trying to take calls."}

Material: feels and looks professional, good color (a darker shade of red) which seems at the very least to be water repellent<br \/>2. Zippers: seem strong enough, especially when loaded and a double zipper seam on the computer compartment.<br \/>3. Padding: one of the best features, fully padded backpack straps including the back of the backpack which would sit adjacent to the waist and back.  The best padding surrounds the computer compartment, adjustable on both sides horizontally and on top (with velcro).  I turned several ways with the backpack fully loaded and the computer didn't move an inch.<br \/>4. Compartments: although the pictures may not show all these features, there are two zippers on the face, water bottle pockets on both sides, a pocket with divisions for pencils\/pens\/highlighters and the best one: a secret, zippered compartment which would sit on the small of one's back.<br \/>5.

These have a slightly shiny &#34;texture&#34; print on them... At first I thought the colors were a bit off - the black looks a little like charcoal... etc... but it is the &#34;texture&#34; in the mold. The colors are quite as bright as shown, but I am ok with that... I just wanted to share in case that matters to you.  Didn't really show in the photos well.  But they are interesting.  They included the little attachment (the pokey connector) with each and every band.  If you go to the fitbit site, they will change you separately for each of those - so it's nice to not have to pull that connector out every time you want to change the color of your band.  I did order the &#34;large&#34; even though according to the size chart I could have ordered the &#34;small.&#34;  I like to wear it a bit looser.  They also include a clear &#34;holding&#34; piece to hold the strap.  I don't use those... but they are pretty thin... I don't think with will last for long if you change your bands a lot... but I am only guessing on that.  I really like being able to have choices so this fits the bill nicely.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"A Great and Necessary Cover","text":"Since I wanted to protect my investment in a Kindle Touch, I ordered this cover. I am glad I did. It fits my Kindle Touch perfectly. The four corner straps secure it to the cover, and there is an elastic strap at the lower end that fits around the entire case, making the Kindle impervious to attack by foreign objects in your bag, backpack, what-have-you.<br \/><br \/>I agree with others who have said the cover is a bit pricey, but if you love your Kindle Touch as much as I love mine, you will want to protect it for many years to come with this sturdy jacket.<br \/><br \/>When I purchased the cover, I wondered if the flip design would get in my way. Not to worry. I find myself so focused on what I am reading that I don't even think about it being there.<br \/><br \/>Do not expect to stand the cover up with the Kindle in it. Despite the rubber strips on each end, the cover will slide. Not good.<br \/><br \/>All things said, I recommend this cover. The first (and I hope last) time your Kindle slips out of your hand, you will be glad you have a modicum of protection if the cover is open, and a lot of protection when it is closed and secured."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Compact, Reliable","text":"Previously I was using another make of a 10-port hub and it worked okay, but it did not support USB 3.1, as this does.  Also, it had a very distracting strip of blue light showing that it was powered on.  This one has a tiny \"pilot\" light by each USB outlet, that lights up when that port is active.  I like that much better, as you can tell which ports are active.  Also everything plugs in vertically; my other hub had only 2 vertical ports and the remainder came out of 2 sides.  The side ports did make the cables a little neater, as they laid flat, whereas with this hub they stick straight up and don't look quite as nice.  The hub is compact, better than the older bulkier one that I was using.  You can never have too many USB ports and I am already using 8 of the 10 available, even though my computer is equipped with several also.  Just about every device these days is USB or wireless.  Nothing to do for set-up.  Just plug it in and use it.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"This 12.9\" iPad Pro provides me with the great viewing experience I was looking for and is intuitive to use","text":"My boyfriend is an Apple lover and I prefer Android. I have a Google Nexus 7 that I love, but it's small. However, it was the iPad's 12.9&#34; display that sold me on this version and the ease of setup and use that sold me on the iPad in general.  Apple's reputation also sealed the deal.<br \/><br \/>When doing a side-by-side comparison, I seriously considered the 9.7&#34; iPad Pro with its wide color and true tone display because that offers a richer viewing experience. Also, the 12-megapixel camera of the 9.7&#34; produces more vibrant photos with better resolution than the 8-megapixel pictures taken with this 12.9&#34; iPad Pro. Nevertheless, the large screen on this 12.9&#34; is best for me.  Portability was not an issue because I got this for home use to watch videos and to easily type on the larger virtual keyboard. I've had it for over one month now and love it. Set-up was a cinch. Battery power is also excellent and lasts for over 10 hours.<br \/><br \/>The one negative that I noticed is that Apple does everything in its power to control their users. For instance, I had to wipe out the &#34;sent from iPad notice&#34; when sending an email as I do not want to freely advertise for them. I also dislike how all my boyfriend's iPhone messages that use to go to my Gmail account, now landed only in iMessage on my iPad and none went to Gmail.  At first I thought he was mistaken when he told me he was sending me messages and I no longer got them until I discovered them a day later on the iPad. This required I only use the iPad until we both figured out how to correct that. Nevertheless, I consider this a small annoying price to pay for what is a user friendly device that provides a rewarding viewing experience.<br \/><br \/>In addition to this iPad, I decided to purchase the [[ASIN:B008MOHLVC amPen  hybrid stylus ]] instead of the [[ASIN:B016NY7784 Apple Pencil]] because I did not need the precision of the pencil. Also, since I am periodically using this for watching videos, I purchased the [[ASIN:B00PB2BF56 ZUGU CASE Prodigy Exec Thin Wake \/ Sleep Stand Protective Case]] which fits it perfectly and props the tablet up as high or low to the surface of my desk as I want it. Note that the ZUGU case will not work with the [[ASIN:B0186RZAWQ Apple Smart Keyboard]]; this keyboard acts like its own case. Thankfully, the virtual keyboard was enough for me.<br \/><br \/>Eventually, I'll teach myself more about my iPad via the online manual I downloaded. I love it so much that if my Google Nexus ever fails, I might just purchase the more portable 9.7&#34; iPad Pro for when I want to carry around a tablet (which is infrequently)."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Only works fully on one of three devices I tried but has a nice stereo sound when it works","text":"I tried this speaker on the Google Nexus 7, iPhone 5, and iPad 3.<br \/><br \/>- With the Google Nexus 7 the speaker would only work very well while on Bluetooth connected to Rock Out (the speaker's Bluetooth). If I connected the cable to the headset port, the sound only came out as a whisper.  I verified that the volume was on max on both the speaker and the Nexus 7.  The documentation says &#34;Know that when you're hardwired in for sound, the external controls are optimized for Apple devices.&#34; This explains why my Nexus 7 does not work when wired to the speaker.<br \/><br \/>- With the iPad 3, I was able to connect via the headset port and via Bluetooth without any problems and the sound was adequate but not fantastic even on the highest volume.<br \/><br \/>- With the iPhone 5, I was only able to connect via the headset port. When we connected via Bluetooth no sound would come out of the device. My boyfriend and I tried several times (about 6 times). We tried while on both the cellular network and also on my wi-fi network and were able to connect to Rock Out but never could get the sound to work. There was one time where it disconnected itself when we went back to look but except for that once, it remained connected throughout. There's a Bluetooth Memory reset by turning the speaker on, pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds and then pairing the device with the iPhone.  I verified that the unit was also fully charged.  As long as I was connected via the headset cable I could answer calls by pressing the play button on the unit. However, no matter what my boyfriend and I did, we could not get Bluetooth to work on the iPhone 5.<br \/><br \/>The R0S2 is definitely rugged and when it works the sounds is adequate to very good. Only my boyfriend's iPhone 5 with the OtterBox installed would fit into the case of the unit for storage. Anything larger than this won't fit, which means the device has to be hanging off the unit if Bluetooth does not work or Bluetooth will have to be used so that the case can remain zippered up.<br \/><br \/>Based on my measurements, any item that is 5-1\/2 inches wide by 2-3\/4 inches tall by 1\/2 inch thick should fit inside the case.  I also weighed the case and it was almost one pound (15.7 ounces). For me it is not worth it to carry an extra pound of gear backpacking.  Also, unless one is kayaking, biking, or out in the sun, the unit does not charge in the shade and according to the directions, it takes 8 hours to fully charge via solar power.<br \/><br \/>As long as there was some sun, I noticed the unit charging.  As per the directions, it will take about 8 hours to solar charge.  I charged mine in about 2 hours using my computer's USB port.  The documentation says the run time is 10 hours but after almost two hours of use, I noticed only 2 bars on the charge when I plugged it back in for recharging.<br \/><br \/>The unit can be daisy chained to other Rock Out speakers for more sound.  The unit has a 3.5 mm audio jack (line-level) and a 5V USB charging cord. According to the box, the speakers are 3W. The battery is a Lithium-ion, 3.7V, 800 mAh, 3Wh.<br \/><br \/>Another thing I noticed is that because the case bottom is not totally flat, the speaker has to be balanced to sit upright without falling over. Every time I tried it either fell forward or back so I had to lean it against something.  Of course if it is secured to backpack or bicycle basket this is a non-issue.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I love the rugged case and think the sound is great to just okay depending on the item or material being played or the device it is paired with.  I like that movies can be paused just by pressing the pause button on the speaker or that I can go to the next song by pressing the advance button.  I have a hard time believing that backpackers will want to carry this almost one-pound speaker with them especially if hiking in the woods where there is usually no sun to charge the unit. Even though the bungee cord around the outside of the unit is thin, it has some clip hooks attached for fastening to a backpack or bicycle basket that should keep it secure. I like the olive green color because it is camouflaged for nature as it was designed to take backpacking. I give this 2.6 stars and recommend with reservations because the unit does not always work with the headset jack or on Bluetooth.  Whether it is going to work or not apparently depends on the unit being connected to the device.  When it works it's great; when it doesn't it is disappointing. I think the current price of $129.99 is also a bit steep.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE Dec 20, 2014<br \/><br \/>March 10, 2017 - Today I tried again to pair this with my [[ASIN:B00O0M750W HP OMEN 15-5010nr Gaming Notebook with Beats Audio]] and I was finally able to get it to work where a couple of years ago no sound came out of the speaker.  The unit was fully charged as usual. Pairing seems to be hit or miss."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Easy to get working; don't forget it needs power to work","text":"I got two outdoor security cameras of different brands at the same time.  The other brand I could not get to work and setting it up was complicated and could apparently only be done through a cell phone.  This camera, on the other hand, could be set up with a computer and the setup was easy and I had it working within minutes, for a live feed.  The picture quality is good and I tested in the dark and still got a great picture.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I couldn't get it to record (supposedly it has some built-in memory, although you can also add a memory card for more memory).  For ease of setup and for the live feed, I give it 5 stars.  I'll try to work with it some more and if I get all the features working, will update this review.  Important note:  I got this without giving thought to the fact that I didn't have a good place to mount it outside.  Also, it needs an outlet to be plugged into, as do most security cameras.  I have outside outlets, but nothing up near the roof where I would want to mount this.  The power cord is not long enough to go for a very great distance, so might require an extension cord to run it.  An exposed extension to a security camera is not very secure, as all anyone would need to do is unplug it to disable the camera.  I thought perhaps I could just keep it inside and aim it out of a window.  Unfortunately my windows sills are two narrow for the camera to sit and shoot out of a window.  I didn't find a good way yet to mount in front of a windows.  Of course my lack of planning is no fault of the camera.  The camera seems rugged and well built.  It appears to be able to use 5Ghz Wi-Fi; the other camera I tested did not.  There is one slight design flaw; the aerial is very close to the mounting bracket, so it is difficult to position it properly."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Makes It Super Easy to Extract, Back Up, Share Photos Stored on Mobile Devices","text":"IBI - THE SMART PHOTO MANAGER (US Version) makes it super easy to extract, back up, and share photos stored on my mobile devices.  Instead of emailing cell phone photos that I want to share among electronic devices (an iPad Air (3rd Gen), a desktop PC, and a Samsung Galaxy cell phone), I can upload the photos to Ibi via a network connection with only a couple of clicks in the Ibi app.<br \/><br \/>No longer do I have to address an email, select and add the photos, send the email--and then reverse the process on a second device (open the email, download the photos, and save the photos to the device).  All that\u2019s necessary is to take the photos, open the Ibi app, choose \u201cimport photos\u201d, select the photos, and hit the import button.<br \/><br \/>The photos are immediately uploaded to Ibi, and I can access them immediately on all of my other devices.  There is no need to clutter up email or to consume precious storage space on my mobile devices, when all I want to do is share photos.<br \/><br \/>Ibi is extremely versatile.  It allows you to sort and organize photos, and create Albums.  It allows you to authorize certain people to email photos directly to Ibi.  It allows you to set up different areas of Ibi for the use of individuals.  It allows you to upload its contents to a PC or other even larger storage device by plugging in a USB cable (not included).  It even allows you to stream your videos to a television set (using Chromecast or Roku apps).<br \/><br \/>Ibi is easy to set up, using Bluetooth.  My iPad and my Galaxy phone both found the powered on (plugged in) Ibi in less than 30 seconds.  Once set up, Ibi communicates via your home network\u2019s Internet access.  When your Ibi app is set up, click on Help, and download the complete user manual (a PDF file).  The manual is easy to understand, and will enable you to get the most out of your Ibi.<br \/><br \/>Ibi is a small drive that easily fits on a bookshelf.  It uses just one power cord.  I really love this Ibi storage drive.  It is simplifying my life.<br \/><br \/>+++++IMPORTANT NOTE: You should NOT choose \u201cautomatic backup\u201d in the Ibi app Settings until you understand how the app works.  With automatic backup enabled, Ibi will copy all of the photos stored on EACH mobile device, and you will probably get a lot of duplicate photos.  For example, if you have been sharing and storing the same photos on an iPad and a cell phone, Ibi will copy the photos from each device.  Worse, if you go into Ibi and delete the duplicates, Ibi will keep automatically adding the photos back as long as the photos still exist in storage on the two different devices.<br \/><br \/>You will probably want to use \u201cautomatic backup\u201d when you first set up your Ibi.  That way all of your photos will be automatically copied to Ibi to start you off.  But you should turn \u201cautomatic backup\u201d off before you start deleting duplicate photos.  You will never have a problem with duplicate photos if automatic backup is turned off.+++++"}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"It will break and Logitech doesn't honor warranties","text":"In the beginning, you will love this remote. But it will break. Guaranteed. We had one stop working, and Logitech replaced it. We dropped the replacement once (just from coffee table to floor, but it's fragile!) and the screen cracked. We were upset that it broke so easily but knew it was damage not covered by warranty, so we didn't submit a claim. We figured we'd just had a freak accident\/bad luck, and bought a third one. One day I picked that one up and the screen was whited out. Over the next few days, black started to seep across the screen from one edge. By the time I had to send a picture of the remote to Logitech for our warranty claim, you could see cracks at the edge. That remote was never dropped. My best guess it that I set it down on the side table as though it were a remote, not a Faberge egg. Logitech refuses to honor their warranty. It's like beating your head against a wall. Lots of \"I understand you must be frustrated,\" and no actual help. Not acceptable for a product that costs so much. Mine is not the only review that says this -- please believe it!

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great!","text":"For a lot of the battery powered items in our home, my husband prefers using rechargeable batteries. As wonderful as they are, they do seem to stop holding a charge after a few years of continuous use. These came at a great time when he needed to replace some of the old ones. First of all, we loved that these come precharged. I don't think that's the norm. I remember having to charge previous ones first. We did try them out in the our charger and they fit fine. Our living room remotes all have new batteries and are all working as expected. There has been no noticeable decrease in power over the last 10 days or so since changing them. I would definitely reorder these in the future."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great headphones!","text":"We are a family of noise cancelling headphones.  What I loved about these phones:<br \/>1. Great bass and really enjoyable experience whether music or audible books;<br \/>2. I have a big head, they fit comfortably as the design allows for a great level of flex on how the ear phones fit on your head;<br \/>3. The functional buttons are on both sides!  And they are big enough that you can  without pressing the wrong button.  Too many times, the high end phones cram all the buttons on one side - why?<br \/>4. The noise cancelling works!  We tested with our air conditioner on - it\u2019s a rattler.  Totally stripped out that noise and still enjoyed listening to my music.  Great to use on TV with Bluetooth.  Used it whilst I was walking in my concrete jungle environment.  Totally enjoyed listening to audible books.<br \/>5. Comes with a beautiful case and add ons for airplanes, or connector if you don\u2019t want to use the Bluetooth functionality.  Bluetooth was easy to connect to our various Bluetooth devices: android and Apple."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"blink add on","text":"After spending MANY times more than what you can buy a three camera Blink system for, we are THRILLED with our Blink systems.  We have two- each with  5 cameras - so we \"added\" on cameras.  They work seamlessly... effortlessly.  They COME WITH lithium batteries.  Honestly, if my husband and I can figure this out.. ANYONE can.  I love that we don't have to \"buy\" anything else... cloud space.. or monthly rental fee of any kind.  As long as you have wifi... it works.  One way sound - (so no two way talking - but we find we don't need that) - cameras are night vision at night and are perfectly clear.  The system we paid so much more for doesn't work even 1\/2 as well.  *sigh*  Live and learn.  Just wish we would have had Blink first.  Note:  we have our wifi system on a battery back up to help with power outs.. but if your wifi goes down, so do your cameras.. just want to be fair and honest... So far, that has not been an issue.  They just work flawlessly.  Could not be happier with how they work or how easy they are to set up and install.  Also Note:  We purchased the upgraded mount - it is worth the few extra dollars to get the most out of your camera position.  Having said all that... I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.  And I really hope my review was helpful to you some way!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"This bluetooth speaker makes me feel like I'm in a theatre when watching movies or listening to music","text":"I had been eying up the [[ASIN:B00B981XQC Ion Audio Job Rocker Bluetooth Portable Jobsite Sound System]] for a while. I was interested in a highly rated Bluetooth speaker because I had been using my [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] with my Google Nexus 7 since last year but was disappointed with it because that was the only device that the speaker would work with. I could not use it successfully with my HP OMEN Gaming Notebook or my boyfriend's iPhone 5 or iPad 3.<br \/><br \/>I almost purchased the old Job Rocker but did not like that it did not have a USB port. Therefore, when I saw that this recently released Block Rocker IPA76C  was on sale at Costco for $119.99 plus tax, I purchased one immediately and I am thrilled that I did.<br \/><br \/>FEATURES<br \/><br \/>- This Bluetooth speaker pairs beautifully with my Nexus 7, my boyfriend's iPad 3 & iPhone 5, my BLU Life One 4G LTE SmartPhone that I use only as a portable tablet, and my HP OMEN. All I had to do was press the Bluetooth button on the speaker after I activated Bluetooth on the devices.<br \/><br \/>- There's an auxiliary cable with stereo 3.5mm (1\/8\") input that can be used to connect a CD or MP3 player and such to the unit.<br \/><br \/>- A microphone is supplied with volume control.  At first I had trouble getting the MIC to work but once I turned off Bluetooth, it worked okay. It's not a great microphone but good enough.<br \/><br \/>- There's AM\/FM radio with 6 presets and a \"rubber\" covered antenna.<br \/><br \/>- This Block Rocker can be paired \/ linked with another one for even more amplified power.<br \/><br \/>- There's an On\/Off power switch in the back.<br \/><br \/>- It has wheels, side carrying grips, and a luggage handle making it portable enough to roll it around like luggage.<br \/><br \/>- There are two 5V 1A USB ports for charging devices. I charged my phone with this port.<br \/><br \/>- When not connected to a wall outlet via the supplied power plug, the internal battery is rated at 75 plus or minus hours of battery life depending on conditions associated with temperature, age of battery, and volume usage of the speaker.<br \/><br \/>- The manual also says that it can be left plugged in indefinitely and it will not damage the battery (for those like me, who are not planning on taking this to a job site or garden party).<br \/><br \/>I'm truly impressed with the sound and functionality of this speaker; so impressed that I am tempted to buy another one. In addition to home use as a theatre producing surround sound experience, this would also be great for outdoor parties and construction sites and such where there is limited or no electricity.<br \/><br \/>I will update this review if I experience any issues but so far it's WONDERFUL!  As I was leaving Costco, one of their employees said I was going to love it as he purchased one the day before. Also, at another Costco today, they were sold out when I went looking for another one.<br \/><br \/>In the comments section of this review, I attached a link to someone else's great video review on this product. He does a great job of explaining the features of this unit."}

So when the Indigo Marble Protective Camera Cover was available during a recent promotion, I couldn't wait to order it! When it first arrived, she wasn't quite sure what to think of it. Then I explained what it was and how it worked. The look on her face when she &#34;got it&#34; was priceless! Since she doesn't like using her case, she has been wrapping her camera up in a small towel when she takes it places. This wrap is way better than using a towel! First of all, the material is designed for use with cameras and equipment so it's not going to scratch or harm it. The Velcro corners keep it wrapped in place. The pad is even water proof so you can set the camera safely on moist ground.

At first I thought it was our network (Comcast is not always very reliable!), but my husband's laptop, our Wii, our Roku player - everything was working effortlessly with the network.  It was just the desktop with which we were using the adapter that couldn't get onto the internet.  I restarted the computer, reconfigured the adapter, then yay! it detected the network, showed \"excellent\" signal strenth...BUT IT WON'T LOAD ANY PAGES!!!  Why on earth would it tell me I'm good to go, and then not load anything at all?  The troubleshooting on the CD-ROM's user guide is a joke - just tells you to remove the adapter then put it back again.  Even when I went to the trouble to get the wireless router literally within SIGHT of my desktop, the adapter wasn't working (I was afraid the router was originally too far away, but that doesn't seem to be the problem).  This thing is just a total piece of crap.  So, so frustrated with it!<br \/><br \/>**edited to add:  So now it's a week later, and the LED light doesn't even light up.  When I try to reinstall the adapter, it says it's not installed correctly.  I've checked the adapter on 4 different USB ports, nothing.  I've check other peripherals on each of the USB ports, they all work fine.  This piece of junk has literally just STOPPED WORKING altogether.  Nothing, nada, a little black plastic piece of garbage.

Couldn't review it until I actually took it on my vacation to California, and cruise to Mexico. Being that I was going to be doing part of my vacation on land and the other on sea, I was ecstatic to know that I could use this camera all around for the whole trip. And, to top it all off, I didn't have to lug around my regular digital camera. I had been addicted to my little Flip Camcorder previously, but now I am taking the Sanyo everywhere! Not only was the picture quality fantastic, the audio\/stereo sound was almost as good as being there! I love how versatile this camera is and how easily it is to hold and operate (especially considering how technically challenged I am). Within a few minutes of opening the box, I was operating it and taking pictures. Underwater, although a little trickier, was just as easy. Snorkeling in Cabo San Lucas was incredible and I have the most beautiful pictures of underwater sea life that I will be able to appreciate forever. I didn't think I was going to like the color of this camera (think school bus), but actually I found it to be 'hip' looking and I got a lot of compliments from people asking what kind of camera it was. I even took pictures of everyone at the Captain's dinner and have shared them on a website for all the new friends I made.<br \/><br \/>I would definitely recommend the Sanyo VPC-WH1 HD Waterproof camcorder for any one who is looking for an easy to use, versatile camera, that you can take and use every where.

Few things I like and dislike below:<br \/>Pros: Great battery life, fairly portable, case is very protective, powerful charging fast enough to fast charge my phone, enough power to charge my laptop in its regular charging time, enough to power my laptop through simple tasks, great build quality.<br \/><br \/>Cons: Will trip a inbuilt breaker if overloaded which with my laptop happens a lot, cooling fan is extremely loud and is about as loud as my gaming laptops cooling fans, it is fairly large so it isn't pocketable, can take around five or six hours to fully charge, or more depending on what wall adapter you use, has enough juice to recharge my laptop only twice, and can only run my laptop for around 15 to 20 minutes."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"This fan heats up my laptop because the fan is reversed, temperature is only displayed in Celsius, & instructions are horrendous","text":"I selected this because my work computer runs hot and this fan is supposed to cool down a laptop by attaching it to the vent. I tried this on a Dell Latitude E6430 and the LED temperature reading climbs and my laptop heats up when connected. In fact, there's nothing about this product that would make me recommend it. Read on to see what is provided and what about this product is so wrong.<br \/><br \/>WHAT COMES IN THE PACKAGE:<br \/>- 1 laptop cooler fan<br \/>- 1 USB cable<br \/>- 1 plastic connector plate<br \/>- 4 rubber sticky feet and 3 (not 4 as specified) tiny silicone suction cups<br \/>- 1 instruction sheet<br \/>- 4 silicon mouthpieces to connect the fan to the laptop vent<br \/><br \/>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS PRODUCT:<br \/><br \/>- The instructions (picture attached) are incredibly poor and barely make any sense at all.  Here are three sentences that I copied below exactly as written including punctuation and wording (except for the quotes I put around those sentences to indicate they were verbatim).<br \/><br \/>&#34;Products with a bottom bracket accessories, and comes with three super sucker.&#34;<br \/>&#34;Qingtai outlet end notebook, the silicone radiator outlet to trap the notebooks vents guide.&#34;<br \/>&#34;According to the books of the heat, free adjustment&#34;<br \/><br \/>- Assembly is slightly required and I had to figure it out on my own because the instructions were so poor.<br \/><br \/>* To assemble, I took the plastic black connector plate and snapped that into the three holes on the bottom front of the unit; the side closest to the on \/ off knob.<br \/><br \/>* I inserted the suction cups into the three holes in the front of the plate with the suction cups side down. Perhaps I could have used the rubber sticky feet but I'm not sure where to put those. I think the installation of those cushions is optional and I suspect they go either on the bottom of the connector plate or the unit.<br \/><br \/>* I attached one of the four silicone &#34;mouth guards&#34; to the front of the unit. I was sure to use the one that best fit the shape of the laptop vent so that it created a tight seal. Once assembled, I plugged one end of the USB cable into the side of the unit and the other end to a free USB port on my laptop.<br \/><br \/>* After the USB was connected, the temperature is displayed without ever having to turn on the unit or connect it to a laptop.  I noted that the temperature without connecting the fan to my vent and with the fan off read 26.0 C. The LED is only in Celsius so I had to convert the numbers to Fahrenheit because I am not fluent in Celsius.  I do know that the temperature is supposed to go down and not up so I turned on the fan but still did not connect the fan to my vent and the temperature started decreasing to 24.0 C and lower. However, once I connected the fan to the vent the temperature steadily increased to 31, 33, 36, 36.5 C, etc. I repeated all these steps on six separate occasions and got the same results. In exasperation, I decided to turn the unit around by facing the back of the unit toward the laptop vent. Once I did this, the temperature decreased slightly. This means that the fan is rotating the wrong way making this device useless.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this fan heats up the laptop. I suspect the reason for this is because the fan is rotating the wrong way so it is not drawing the heat away from the laptop vent. The temperature LED is only in Celsius which is great for Europeans fluent in that temperature but is not great for the majority of Americans. Also, the instructions are horrendous. My recommendation is to pass on this one.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE Jan 24, 2017 - I tried to see if I could fix this fan but could not. There are three tiny screws holding the body together. One screw is located underneath one of the rubber feet. Once I got it open, I had no way of knowing if the connectors are correct or not. The ribbons inside only go one way and reversing the fan doesn't seem to be an option. Therefore, I decided to throw the unit out since Vine reviewers have no warranty on the products they receive. What a waste."}
{"rating":2.0,"title":"Couldn't get it to connect to my router for wireless control.","text":"This is a good price for a starter kit of 5 devices.  The program you install on your Smartphone is easy to install and looks like it works as intended.  Here's the problem I encountered.  Every time I tried to connect to my router I would get the message \"Only supported on 2.4 GHZ Wifi Networks\".  My router is dual band and I believe it broadcasts WiFi both in 2.4 and 5 GHZ.  Apparently these devices are not seeing the 2.4 GHZ and are looking at 5 GHZ and aren't able to connect or the Smartphone is connecting at 5Ghz and the device won't pair with the phone unless it is connected via 2.4Ghz.  I contacted support and they gave me this answer:  \"You will need to connect your mobile device to the 2.4Ghz Wifi for the app to connect to the devices when they are in the pairing modes. If you are unsure how to connect to the 2.4Ghz of the dual band router, you may need to log into the router to either turn on the 2.4Ghz WiFi or rename it so you know which connection is the 2.4Ghz. If you are unsure how to do so, you will need to contact your router manufacturer for assistance. Alternatively you can pair the devices via AP mode as indicated in the manuals of the devices.\"  I don't know how to make the necessary changes in my router to be able pair the smartphone with the 2.4Ghz connection and I didn't want to take the time to learn how and potentially mess up my router and\/or the way the Smartphone connects to my router. (It seems like I would need to change both.)  I tried the AP Mode that support mentioned, but it still would not connect; it would fail every time.  The whole setup seems just too complicated.  Also, they fail to tell you that at least on the water sensor, you have to twist open the device and remove the paper tab that prevents the battery from making contact, before you can set it up.  Am disappointed and surprised that no other reviewers had the 2.4 vs. 5 Ghz issue.  Not recommended unless you know all about how to set up your smartphone and router to connect at 2.4Ghz or unless they already are."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Not very well made","text":"When I saw this RCA charging dock, I jumped to get it. Normally, I work from home and use one or two plugs to keep all of my Apple items charged throughout the day (rotating them betwen plugs). When I saw this charging dock, I thought it would be a great way to connect my iphone, keep it upright for viewing ease, and keep the phone charged all day long. First, although the picture looks good, the item is cheaply made plastic, which I guess would normally be ok for something like this (although to me in the picture it looked a little sturdier). The 30 point connection does not work well. I had to rock my phone several times to get it start charging (it wasn't easy to see if it is connected properly). Having a charging light on the base would have been a nice-have, but of course there isn't one. I then tried my ipod in there. I found that a little easier to connect, but still takes several attempts of getting it to the right angle to make it work right. To be honest, I think it is just a matter of time before this breaks (given the difficulty I have in connecting). I would honestly say to spend your money elsewhere. This item is not worth the investment."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great for Videos and Pictures","text":"This photo studio table top set is really cool! I have a teenage daughter who loves photography and also likes making her own videos. This kit is perfect for her. She has it set up on her desk and is able to set it all up so she can film\/photograph without any background disturbance. The \u201cbox\u201d itself is collapsible and easy to put up. There are four different solid colored background sheets which are made from a sturdy, non-reflective material. There are 4 lights \u2013 2 halogen and 2 LED ones. Their stands are built into the base of the lights and can be adjusted easily. The tripod is nothing fancy, but she already has one, so if her needs require a bigger tripod, she\u2019s good. It\u2019s taking her a bit of time to figure out which lights are best for various situations, but she\u2019s having fun with it. My husband even used it to take pictures of something he is selling on an online auction site. The \u201cbox\u201d has some storage pockets and almost everything can fit into those so it doesn\u2019t take up much room. We are using this for fun and it works great.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A nice microscope for the money, AmScope honored warranty after a few months","text":"I like everything about this microscope except for 1) the mechanical stage and 2) AmScope not honoring their warranty terms.  I ordered this microscope directly from AmScope.  After a few months of use, the arm on the mechanical stage broke off.  I requested warranty service, sent in pictures, and was told I would be advised when a replacement arm or stage was approved and shipped.  But I never did hear from AmScope.  The warranty request was effectively denied though I believe the claim was quite valid.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE:  Amscope did finally honor the warranty after a few months and did send me a new mechanical stage.  Apparently during a personnel transition my approved RMA didn't get passed along to the right departement.  Or something.  But I'm a happy Amscope customer now.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Great Concept; Hardware Design, Setup Software Needs Improvement","text":"UPDATE (2\/21\/19):  So far, my clock is working well.  I did buy a second clock, and succeeded in pairing it with my 1st Gen Echo Show.  If you make a pairing mistake, you can press the clock's pairing button 5 times to unpair the clock and start over.  Oddly, when the Show was correctly paired, the light turned solid orange.  The Echo Show is hard to pair because it isn't completely integrated with the Alexa app when it comes to setting up a wall clock.  However, for me, having two clocks, with visual timer displays paired to different Echo devices, was worth all the Setup hassles.<br \/><br \/>This ECHO WALL CLOCK does two things that I really want.  First, it keeps accurate time by using an Internet connection (through an Echo device) instead of a radio signal (which can malfunction in bad weather or at Daylight Savings Time changes).  Second, it gives a bright visual display of the time remaining on all the timers currently set with my first-generation Echo.  (Yes, it simultaneously displays the time left on multiple timers.)<br \/><br \/>If my clock continues to work without requiring frequent Bluetooth re-pairing (as other reviewers have reported), I will order a second clock to pair with my Echo Show.  The visual time-left display is very useful when I\u2019m timing exercises or post-exercise ice treatments.<br \/><br \/>The instructions warn you NOT to try to move the clock hands. (Other reviewers warn that touching the hands will break the clock, or cause it to tell slightly inaccurate time forever if you succeed in replacing the hands.)  It\u2019s too bad that the clock does NOT have a plastic cover over the face--dusting it is going to be a problem.  I put mine on a wall, to protect it as much as possible from dust, and from accidentally being knocked over.<br \/><br \/>SETUP PROBLEMS:  Out of the box, the clock paired effortlessly with my Echo Show (using the option of asking the Show to set up the clock).  However, I ran into a lot of difficulty when I tried to pair it with a second device (a first-generation Echo).  The instructions do NOT make it clear that the clock PAIRS WITH ONLY ONE ECHO DEVICE.<br \/><br \/>Probably because I failed to start the second Setup attempt by using the Alexa app to un-pair the clock from the Show, the second attempt failed.  It ended with a green light that has no defined meaning in the paper or online setup instructions.  Worse, the clock no longer worked with the Show.  Still worse, the clock did NOT appear as a device in the Alexa app; and the app did NOT display the clock as a Connected or Bluetooth device under the Show settings.<br \/><br \/>Eventually I found the clock under the settings for the Echo (subject of my second, failed Setup attempt).  I was able to unpair it, delete it, and start Setup again.  At long last, the clock paired with the Echo, and began working again (with the first-generation Echo).<br \/><br \/>However, I failed in all attempts to use the Show to set up the clock again. Those attempts always concluded with a red error light or with that mysterious green light. At some point, I had to remove the batteries and replace them so that the pairing button on the clock would work.  Naturally I now dread having to pair the clock again with any Echo device, should the Bluetooth connection malfunction.<br \/><br \/>SUMMARY:  The concept of the Wall Clock is great.  I love my clock now, and really do intend to buy a second one, if the clock that I now have continues to work normally.  However, I hope that later generations of the Echo Wall Clock will have a covered clock face, and that later versions of the Setup software will have much better integration with the Alexa app."}

In addition, there are time when I would like to have my ipad plugged into the rear top dock and watch something on netflix.  I can't do it because the netflix app runs in landscape mode and the ipad must be up & down to be plugged in.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Radio But Not Perfect","text":"First of all, my first order arrived with a small crack in the wooden cabinet and it would not turn on. I am going to give Sangean the benefit of the doubt and assume that it was shipping damage even though the box from the outside did not look like it was damaged, so I won't let this affect my rating.<br \/><br \/>But this did give me a chance to test Amazon's return policy, and I must say it was great. When I realized that I had to return the radio, I went to Amazon's website and clicked on the radio and selected \"return.\" Then I was prompted to print a return shipping label to attach to the box when I sent it back. By the time I did that, there was an email in my in box from Amazon telling me that they were shipping a replacement to me via UPS Air. So I packed up the unit in it's original box, attached the label I had printed, and then the next day when the replacement arrived I gave the box to the UPS driver. Of course, all of this was at no additional cost to me. I was quite impressed with the whole process.<br \/><br \/>Now to the radio itself. Overall I am quite impressed with it and I am giving it four stars. For a radio of it's size, it sounds great. I have never heard a radio that small with the tight bass response that this one has. And AM radio sounds better than than it does even on my Onkyo receiver that I have in my family room.<br \/><br \/>The radio with it's wooden cabinet looks great on my nightstand and you can just tell by looking at it that it is a quality product.<br \/><br \/>The tuner's sensitivity on the FM band is good with the external wire antenna that is supplied with it. Selectivity between adjacent stations is also good. And I am getting good stereo separation when I listen with headphones. I do have one small quibble however. There is a button to switch any FM station to mono, but you have to do this individually for each station. It would have been better if you could toggle between stereo and mono for all the stations at once rather than having to do it individually for each one.<br \/><br \/>AM sensitivity is pretty good using the built in antenna. Weak stations in my area come in better than they did with my old clock radio, but I still do have some problems with the very weak stations. I could probably improve this if I bought a good external AM antenna, but I don't think I will bother to do that since I don't really listen to any of the weak stations anyway.<br \/><br \/>One reason why I got this radio was because it has a line in jack. I have connected my Directv box to it so that I can listen to the Directv music channels through the radio without having my TV set on. All I had to do was to go to Radio Shack and buy a Y adapter with two RCA plugs on one end and a 1\/8\" plug on the other. It works like a charm.<br \/><br \/>I also like that the display has large enough numerals that I can read it without my glasses on. However, as others have mentioned, the display defaults to the radio station frequency or the RDS display rather than to the time. To get the time display back I have to tap the display button, and it's hard to do at night in a dark room. I think it would have been better if it defaulted to the time in the first place.<br \/><br \/>Another quibble that I have is that the power button uses a bright blue light which is distracting in a dark room. They shouldn't have made it so bright. That will take some getting used to.<br \/><br \/>Also, as others have mentioned, setting the alarm is needlessly complicated as is turning it off. You need to hit three different buttons to do it. I am starting to get the hang of it, but I wish they would have just included a button which toggles the alarm on and off.<br \/><br \/>But overall I am rating this as a good four star product that could use some minor improvements. The most important thing to me is the sound quality, and that is unmatched for a radio of this size."}

The keyboard is darned good, too.  Both keyboard and mouse are wireless--they are controlled by a single USB dongle that plugs into a USB port on a  Win7, Win8, or Win10 (or later) device.<br \/><br \/>The keyboard is completely noiseless.  The keys are responsive.  The \u201chome\u201d keys are a little bit hard to find by feel--I only wish that the raised marker bars were raised a little more, or made a bit larger.<br \/><br \/>The USB dongle is \u201cplug and play\u201d.  That is, you plug it in, and wait a very short time for the Windows OS to recognize it and set it up.  The keyboard and mouse will work even if you have another keyboard and mouse installed.<br \/><br \/>The mouse requires one AA battery (included).  To change the battery, just lift off the top of the mouse.  The keyboard requires two AA batteries (included).  To change the keyboard batteries, you push up the strip across the top (the part with \u201cLogi\u201d on it).  The keyboard battery compartment has a space for storing the dongle when you take the keyboard on the road.<br \/><br \/>The price (about $49 on Amazon) is extremely reasonable for such a high-quality mouse and keyboard combo."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Upgraded from the DT 770 Pro and am very happy I did!","text":"I had the DT 770 Pros 80 ohm for several years. I had been eyeing an upgrade to the 770's and I was looking for another closed back set. The main contenders were the DT 1770 Pro and the Massdrop 177x GO. I was able to try both and decided to stick with the 1770s over the 177x (I paid approx the same price for both, so price was not an issue). I'll discuss a few of the things I really like about the headphones below.<br \/><br \/>Firstly, the 1770 Pros are SUPER solid and very high quality. As soon as you pick them up, you know they are pure class. The 1770 was noticeably more solid than the 177x, so this was an easy point. The 1770 also comes with a nice carrying case for the headphones, which was a great selling point for me. The case holds the headphones, an additional pair of ear-pads (it comes with leather and velour), and the cables (both coiled and straight), which are detachable. The non detachable cables were a big pain point on the 770 Pros.<br \/><br \/>Sound quality- amazing. I know some people don't love the sound, but I enjoy a bass-y sound, and comparing these with the 177x's, these came out ahead in my mind (or ears).<br \/><br \/>Lastly, comfort- these SHINE here. Beyerdynamic is known for their comfort and the 1770 Pros are no exception. I wear these for 6+ hours per day (thanks WFH) with no issues at all. I think comfort is underrated when looking for headphones, and fortunately, these don't skimp in that department.<br \/><br \/>Long story short, these are great headphones. I came from the 770 Pro's and these are a worth successor. Very well built, great sound, very comfortable. Would buy again."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Easy to Install","text":"My husband has installed a few different dash cams over the past few years. This one was easy to install. It fits over your existing mirror. It works pretty good for the most part. We did find it somewhat distracting. When you turn the car on, it starts out by showing you the view of the what the camera is seeing at that moment. You can set it so it turns off after a minute and goes back to the mirror view and blanks the screen. We just found that to be distracting. Other cameras that we have used don't do that. The actual camera quality is good, not great, but adequate. We haven't used the rear camera that is included because all of our cars already have rear cameras."}

In theory, most tend to put their expensive phones in a protective case\u2026 So, it only makes sense to do the same with the ohh so, expensive accessories...!!!<br \/> This fun marble printed protection case lives up to the colorful photo! Keep in mind this is a \u201ccase within a case mentality\u201c and not a skin! What? A skin is decorative in purpose and meant to individualize the outside appearance making your unit unique.. (hence the name, \u201cskin!\u201d) I like the fact that it has substance to it- only, not sure how much protection comes from this type of cover?  The outer shell is hard and it has a liner made of a very thin, almost neoprene like material .. Being I had a phone in the past made similar, and that I really liked as it proved sturdy.. I feel this creation will do the same. (I will definitely update if I see different results!)<br \/>Also know- this is 2 separate pieces..  and that may matter to some? I\u2019ve seen these when they have a hinge attaching the top\/bottom- However, this does not.  I was worried how to keep the top in place but,  as you slide it over the top lid of AirPod case.. it suctions down nice\/tight.<br \/><br \/> We do not have the cordless charging capacity with our AirPods so, I cannot say for certain if this would hinder that feature? With the pair we own- you must plug it in to charge...<br \/><br \/>The added bonus to clip this to your bag or lanyard is nice- but, I suggest if using this feature and depending on it to stay secure.. I would get a better quality carabiner and replace it with the one provided.  You can definitely see the carabiner given is not to the quality standard needed to secure such an expensive item! For $2-$3, you can have a clip that not only attaches the same way.. but, will give the strength and security in its function. Worth it for sure...!!!<br \/> I\u2019m pleased with the item received and feel it fits nice, looks good and can only help in the overall protection!"}

We love the easy of set up and allowing you to out in a large number of electrical devices onto one remote.<br \/><br \/>So we decided to try this one for our bedroom devices and we were somewhat disappointed with the limitations on this model:<br \/><br \/>1.  when using the harmony software there were a lot of limitations when compared with the 900 (and previous models).  The limitations included:<br \/>a> couldnt change the order of the activities. ie if you want dvd ahead of music, you would not do that.  To over come this: you need to preplan the order at which the devices are set up.  In the more expensive models and in previous older models, you could set everything up and then re-order them.<br \/><br \/>b. once you are in a device: it only offers you four functions on the face, instead of 6 to eight.  to overcome this you need to scroll to another page.<br \/><br \/>c.  the device has four hard buttons to operate only four devices.  Hence this remote is not useful if you have a decent home theatre. okay for a bedroom with a TV, tivo, dvd and music system.<br \/><br \/>Typical features of the device: all the button light up in the dark, except for the four device buttons and the help button (so you need to learn where they are on the remote).  A good thing about this device  (we also have the 900) is that the bottom half of the device have a very similar layout so no learning where the volume, channel button are placed.<br \/><br \/>The software is similar to other harmony remote, but once you indicate which remote you have: the choices are very limited.<br \/><br \/>It is worth buying the 900 and above for living room devices; and if you could find the 880, its former model, get it as the functionalities are much better.  And yes, the software will support this older model.  Buy the 700 if it is only for a couple of applicances.  However, if you are a harmony user, you will feel a little frustrated with the limitations of this model."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Absolutely Fantastic Piece of Design","text":"I have always puttered around with graphics programs and fought with the mouse the whole way.  I have tried tablets in the past either through my role as IT support to designers or with a smaller [[ASIN:B002OOWC3S Wacom Bamboo Pen and Touch Small Tablet]] which proved to be too small to be very useful.  When I started using this device it was eye opening.  Suddenly I was able to out line items in photoshop with the ease of sketching with a pencil.<br \/><br \/>The design is beautiful and rich.  My earlier memories of Wacom tablets were stacks of obsolete and yellowing plastic.  This device has a beautiful dark gray surface which should age gracefully and avoid the yellowing of the earlier models. Opening the packaging felt like Christmas.<br \/><br \/>Functionally the device is amazing.  I have used it on quite a few projects and the preset keys are great for adding or removing selected areas on the fly without going back to the keyboard.  Zooming in and out with the touch wheel also flows well.  Once in drawing mode, I never need to return to the computer keyboard at all.  Initially I was disappointed to find that the USB port on the tablet appeared to be on the wrong side, then I realized a small switch closed that port and opened one on the other side - an amazing little detail.  As a leftie, I was worried how it would work for us minority handers, it works exactly the same - again, amazing.<br \/><br \/>If I had to knock the device for anything, I find the tablets surface a little rough for my taste and I have noticed that the stylus point wears and marks the surface when using it.  It's not horrible, but a little irritating.  Other than that I can do little more than gush about how surprisingly much I have loved this tablet.  The pressure controls in brushes are - I have to say it again - amazing.<br \/><br \/>After using it for some time, I'm not sure how I got along without it.  The pixel for pixel mapping is far better than my earlier Bamboo tablet.  I love it! highly recommend it to everyone I know."}

It's also the perfect desktop for any business with a marketing department. I watched this video and was totally hooked. I have been doing PowerPoint presentations for 24 years and this blows it out of the water.<br \/><br \/>What finally hooked me to it's creative potential at the office was watching two 3 minute videos on YouTube:<br \/>&#34;HP Sprout Review&#34; and &#34;Using the Capture Feature on Sprout by HP&#34; - amazing<br \/><br \/>Hook up was easy as I expected about 20 minutes to unbox everything and less than an hour to get everything running<br \/><br \/>Now, right now I am not in a financial picture to buy the 3D printer or imaging stand (even tho the prices are not outrageous),but I can still get a designed printed by establishing a free account with HP's 3D printing partner. FYI the Dremel is the highest rated model by '3D Engineer' just go to their sight and search &#34;dremel-idea-builder-review&#34; it gave me a lot of easily understandable information if I decide to go that route. You can also go to the Dremel site '3dprinter dot dremel' the videos there helped me learn a lot about how this 3D printing works. Lastly, I read a informational article at 'makezine' that you can find on the internet &#34;dremel-3d-printer-idea-builder&#34;.<br \/><br \/>Ok, so the next stop on my journey of discovery was HP where I searched 'Sprout'. So I watched the videos and skimmed the tech stuff. WELL worth your time - I truly think it saved me a TON of time. If object design is your thing or you are looking to get your high school or college kid into computer design this desk top will hook them. It's just so creative! One tip when getting started, on the HP site I put a query of &#34;Sprout&#34; in the search engine and got a nice small list of use links PLUS a dedicated SPROUT FORUM for users where HP folks jump in all the time with helpful information and trouble shooting help.<br \/><br \/>Ok, I really wanted to so how the 3D works so I created a free account with the HP 3D printer partner Sculpteo - it could not be easier. First stop for me was searching the Sculpteo site for '3D Printing Price and Payment Methods' and 'help\/#price-calculation'. You can see it doesn't have to be ridiculously expensive - but it can be - the larger the object the bigger the cost. The site is very user friendly and immersive, even if you don't plan to print right off take a look, it is fascinating. A very good article &#34;Sculpteo Opens its 3D Printing Cloud Engine to the Public, BY ANDREW WHEELER MAY 8, 2015&#34; explained how this all works. Also &#34;HP & Sculpteo Partner to 3D Print Directly from Sprout BY DAVIDE SHER AUGUST 3, 2015&#34;. Both are most helpful. If you care to read super there are 3 other articles about Sculpteo I read:<br \/><br \/>Sculpteo: French, Web-Based 3D Printing Service Sculpteo Puts Down Roots in Silicon Valley by Debra Thimmesch | Sep 30, 2015<br \/>Staples\u2019 New Sculpteo-Powered Online 3D Printing Service Launches by Scott J Grunewald | Sep 17, 2015<br \/><br \/>Finally go to you tube and watch a demo &#34;Baig: Here's what HP's new Sprout can do&#34;.<br \/><br \/>I did all this reading and watching while I was waiting for the 55 pound box to arrive and have been playing with it the last 30 days with no complaints at this time. I have only used the presentation creation piece so far but once my college kid gets his hands on it this summer I expect a lot of creativity that should be pretty cool."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Decent Sound & Quality","text":"This portable speaker was a little larger than I expected. I have a couple of portable Bluetooth speakers and they are all pretty small. This is also a little more rugged than those are, too. It's not only larger, but it's also pretty thin making it easy to transport. It won't take up much room in a backpack or tote bag. The sound quality is decent and a little better than the other portable BT speakers that I have - that could be the difference between a name brand such as Magnavox and the no name ones that I have. My husband and I like to listen to music outside on the patio or in the hot tub and this works very well for that. The volume gets loud enough for small gatherings, but probably wouldn't work for a large party where it would have to compete with talking and other noises.  The controls are easy to use and it was very easy to pair with my Android phone. There's a rubber covering that goes over the USB port which I found a bit difficult to replace, not impossible though. Just difficult. The handle is just a flexible piece of plastic or vinyl. Overall, I think it's a good quality BT speaker."}

So for right now it does not have a use, but it was a fun experiment and I am hoping that someday the older kids will pick it up and use it to enclose a new experiment .  It is a nice little enclosure, it installed easily and it has a lot of potential for making a small all in one device (minus battery.)  There is some talk of creating board game controls with it by making a simple html site with some randomized php for dice.  I expect that it will be put into some use this summer."}

This is barely less than the bare bones dvd player we were trying to keep using.  It works well and sound and picture are good.  It does what we need, and we are happy that we can keep getting use out of a vintage player.

The sound was great. I also paired it with my boyfriend's iPhone and was able to answer a call by pressing the phone image on the speaker.<br \/><br \/>It supposedly connects to up to two phones simultaneously, but I did not have another phone to try it with. Also, there is a hands-free option but in order to use it, one would have to be playing music via a Bluetooth enabled in car device at the time a call was coming through or via the micro SD card. The rest of the time, when a call comes in, the phone button has to be pressed. This means it is not entirely hands free.<br \/><br \/>I did find that no matter what device I paired it with, that each device took time to find this speaker. The first pairing was the most difficult and I had to turn Bluetooth on and off several times and press the M button to wait until it registered. It took a while, but T826 is what it comes up as.<br \/><br \/>Besides the sound this small speaker generates, I like the removable magnetic clip on the back. It is easy to attach to a sun visor.  There is also a slot for a micro SD card where an MP3\/WMA audio file can be played from.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is very functional. It has a lanyard for carrying that also makes it portable. The unit has to be charged every once in a while.

The beauty of the product is its simplicity of design and quality.  There is a little blue cloth to wipe down your screen, then the screen protector is wedged between plastic sheet 1 and 2: peel and one side will have slight, ever so slight stickiness... Then roll slowly over the screen and use the little brown plastic tab to push the air bubbles out.  Yep, there is a slight mm gap, but hell you are going to need that to peel it off eventually!  It is part of the design and not a fault in the design!  I am totally okay with the tiniest bubbles on a few of the corners as it does not affect the print.  Yep, I am super glad that I got this screen protector (from dirt and not from too much pressure applying on it!). The anti glare factor, yes, noticed when led lights fall on it, it is much more matted, not that the kindle itself doesnt do a great job in the antiglare department.  Well worth this non too expensive accessory."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Such a powerful punch in a little tower device..!!!","text":"I must confess and give a shout out- I follow the \u201cphantom of Amazon\u201d as he\u2019s practically reviewed every home projector Ive looked at.. Following his detailed pro\/cons lists and why- helped make my decision. He\u2019s a person in the business and knows his stuff.. So, when HE named this one\/if not the best in tower projectors (in this price point) I took his advice and I\u2019m thrilled I did!!<br \/><br \/>As one with zero tech skills- I needed that \u201cguru advice\u201d on a subject I didn\u2019t understand. Along with a few \u201chow to\u201d videos for confidence (I suggest doing this prior to use if unsure on using- it lends so much in the way of confidence!) Im thrilled that one\u2019s advice sent me to the \u201ctower style..\u201d If I set on nightstand or TV tray- it\u2019s truly a perfect height for the screen or mid section of a wall to give you an idea.<br \/><br \/>What I found myself: Its vital to get projector with auto focus BUT, also have ability to fine tune the focus by hand- it gets your picture SO crystal clear. And bc furniture is on carpet- a stabilizer lets you even it up (we had x1 side off from edge of screen every time.. ugh!) We havent used outside yet- but on grass etc.. a stabilizer will be a necessity!!<br \/><br \/>Hack 1: Read instructions- SAVE THEM SAFELY IN PLASTIC SLEEVE\/BAG! double side tape sleeve inside box or projector case (must buy separately!) keeps info. safe and easy to locate always! Hack 1A: using an insulated lunch pack can double as carry case and may even save you $. Hack 2: depending on where using.. who knows how close to power source you\u2019ll be. *Keep extension cord w\/ projector. Doing so will avoid disappointment or obstacle as one goes to use!!<br \/><br \/>Blue tooth is the bomb!! If turned on- it will try to auto sync by sending an invitation to device.. if you follow the prompts, it holds your hand thru all the steps to connect! Funny to see ME type all this..but, trust me- if I can navigate process you can x1000!!! Note: we didn\u2019t need an extra speaker.. x5 of us could hear just fine from the projector alone.. sound is heard on all sides- NICE!! *My son played PS4 games using projector and I actually had to tell him to turn down volume!! Projector was causing too much ruckus- ha.. that\u2019s always a good sign!<br \/><br \/>So grateful this is user-friendly and end results surpassed all expectations. I so recommend getting a specified bag\/backpack to transport and store the projector in.. it protects your investment and keeps it contained! Hoping info can help decision making in a layman sort of way! sorry so long-winded.. stay safe everyone."}

It's very intuitive.<br \/><br \/>Note: You will have to register with the FAA for this drone, if you have not done so already and add you reg label to it.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>Flying time lasts about 30ish min. Comes with 33GB Mico SD card. Remote is easy to use and my Iphone X Max pairs well with it to see live video feed. Comes with extra propellers. Easy to store or travel with.  Video is 4k resolution up to 60 frames per second (4K60, 2.7K60, 1080p120, 720p240). Range is said to be over 4 miles but there is no way I would feel comfortable flying it that far.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Switches Between Two Paired Devices; Richer Sound, Clearer Voices From Sony Bravia TV","text":"This BOSE SOUNDLINK COLOR BLUETOOTH SPEAKER may not be the ideal portable speaker for serious audiophiles--because it has no treble\/base buttons, only volume buttons--but I love mine.  The sound is rich and full, whether it's paired with my old Sony Bravia TV, iPad2, or Kindle Fire, or connected by AV stereo cable (3.5mm M\/M) to my MP3 player's headphone jack.  The volume is controlled by the device the speaker is connected to, or by the plus\/minus volume buttons on the speaker itself.  The speaker also has an Aux button for the direct cable connection, and a Skip button that lets you go forward or backward in your music selections.<br \/><br \/>This Bose portable speaker can support two Bluetooth-connected devices at once, so you can switch between two devices (e.g., an iPad and a Kindle Fire) without repeating the pairing process every time.  A great feature!  The speaker automatically connects with the last-connected Bluetooth device, and switches devices when you press the Bluetooth button.  The speaker's voice prompts help you with pairing, and tell you which two devices are currently paired.  The voice prompts can be disabled, if you wish.<br \/><br \/>This Bose speaker is definitely an improvement over the speakers built into my old Sony Bravia TV.  Voices are much clearer--including the dialogue from British TV shows--and the sound is far richer.  Of course, using this speaker instead of a TV sound bar is only a temporary solution, because the speaker needs regular recharging.  When fully charged, it delivers sound for many hours (up to 8) and outlasts the charge on the [[ASIN:B004B8GF7Y TaoTronics\u00ae Bluetooth Transmitter]] that I added to my non-Bluetooth-enabled TV.<br \/><br \/>Whether the TaoTronics transmitter was connected to the TV's headphone jack or to the TV's AV ouputs, this speaker paired instantly.  However, when the TV transmitter was connected to the AV outputs, the speaker produced some static unless it was positioned close to the TV.  When the TV transmitter was connected to the headphone jack, the speaker produced no static at all, no matter where it was positioned (within the Bluetooth range).<br \/><br \/>This Bose speaker charges quickly with the included AC adapter and USB cable.  Pressing the speaker's power button produces a battery indicator that glows red, amber, or green to indicate the current level of charge.  The speaker is lightweight enough to carry around in a backpack or tote bag.  There is a case available (see [[ASIN:B00NJGRKG4 Bose SoundLink Color carry case]]), but I don't think a case is needed, because the speaker seems to be sturdily constructed."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Fits our needs, but not quite perfect","text":"First - What I was looking for<br \/><br \/>My wife has been working on a series of juvenile fiction books over her summer breaks.  Much of that time has been spent at the municipal pool for kids' swim lessons or open swims.  So we were looking for a waterproof, functional cover for her iPad (I know, who writes books on an iPad, but she is an adept hunt and peck typer and it works well for her.)<br \/><br \/>What we got<br \/><br \/>As for protection and performance, we got exactly what we were looking for.  It is not waterproof, but it is secure enough for the potential poolside splashing and dripping.  The double zip-locks form strong secure seals.  The screen works well for her typing and allowed her to have all the functionality she was looking for.  At least for the poolside purposes.<br \/><br \/>What wasn't quite up to our hopes.<br \/><br \/>It is not exactly easy to slip the iPad in and out of this case.  Personally I think it borders on being enough hassle that it may make her decide not to use it in the long run.  Also the iPad needs to be removed for charging or access to the headphone port etc. Obviously this is needed for water-proofing, but this does make it less likely to be used.<br \/><br \/>Also we had a small issue when we left the cover in the car at below freezing temperatures then brought it in. I did not let it warm before trying to open the seals and one of the seal rails cracked.  It still makes a good seal, but should not be opened or closed at freezing temperatures.<br \/><br \/>Summary<br \/><br \/>While not perfect, it should be perfect for our needs.  Construction is good (see note on sub zero temperatures)and functionality is good. All in all happy with it."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Performs as Advertised--Turns PS4, Other Devices On\/Off; Controls, Navigates PS4 \"Media\"","text":"If you read the product description carefully, you won't waste time (as I did) trying to use this PLAYSTATION 4 UNIVERSAL MEDIA REMOTE to navigate PS4 games (e.g., Journey, Minecraft).  The PS4 remote uses Bluetooth to turn your PS4 on and off, and to control and navigate PS4 media (e.g., DVDs), but only controls PS4 media.  The PS4 remote can also be programmed to turn your TV, Cable Box, and Audio Receiver on and off, and to control and navigate those devices (assuming they accept remote Bluetooth operation).<br \/><br \/>The PS4  remote performs the advertised functions very well, and I'm happy with it.  The main thing I wanted was the PS4 on\/off feature, so that I wouldn't have to fool with the skinny button on the PS4 box when I wanted to play a DVD.  But I also wanted something that would make it easier to navigate DVDs.  I'm not much of a gamer, and I find the game controllers awkward to use.  With the PS4 remote, the forward, back, play, and arrow buttons work &#34;normally&#34; (like any TV remote).<br \/><br \/>NOTE THAT once the PS4 remote is paired, you will turn the playstation &#34;on&#34; by pressing the big PS4 button, but you will turn it &#34;off&#34; by navigating to the PS4's power settings (in the display).  (The PS4 remote doesn't have a &#34;sources&#34; button for bringing up the output options on my Samsung Smart TV, so I still need a second remote for selecting the PS4 output.)<br \/><br \/>The Bluetooth pairing and setup for the PS4 remote is straightforward, but you need to follow the directions in the accompanying booklet &#34;to the letter&#34;.  You have to visit several locations in the PS4 settings to add the remote to the PS4 device list, and then complete the setup.<br \/><br \/>Programming the remote to turn on another device (TV, Cable Box, Amplifier, etc.) is exactly the same as programming any universal remote.  You turn on the device you're programming, put the remote into learning mode, point it at the device, and wait for the remote to find, recognize, and turn off the device.  If the remote doesn't recognize the device, you must perform the device code programming manually (lots of codes are listed in the instruction booklet).  The PS4 remote recognized my TV without difficulty, but my sound bar required manual programming.<br \/><br \/>Once you've programmed the various other devices, you switch between those devices by pressing the little labeled buttons (PS4, TV, AMP, CBL).  Which brings me to the only thing that I don't like about the PS4 remote--the buttons (especially the switching buttons) are quite small, because there are so many of them packed onto this rather narrow remote."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Long Enough for Most Uses; Not Bulky; Works Good","text":"I like to keep a variety of lengths of Ethernet Cables, as I never know when I might want to relocate something.  Unfortunately most long cables tend to take up a lot of space.  This flat cable is much more compact.  The flat design makes it nice to place up against a wall and there are included mounting clips for a wall or baseboard, that have a small nail that you just hammer in.  I don't know what the maximum length limit is for Ethernet.  I suspect that after a certain length, speed might be impacted, but I didn't see any degradation in speed or performance with this over 65 foot long cable.  I am very satisfied with this and while I don't quite yet need a cable this long, I may some day.  If you don't need the full length, it is very easy to coil up a portion of the cable; easier than round cables.  I like it and would buy this again if I should need another."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Excellent WI-FI coverage; setup can be tricky; support may be questionable","text":"For performance, I would rate this a solid 5-stars.  I bought a quality $300 router before this one and it just wouldn't fully cover the house with adequate wi-fi strength.  I spent $100 more on an extender, which finally helped somewhat, but still not ideal.  The router in this D-Link system has good strong wi-fi signal by itself, but it includes an extender which make it even better.  Excellent wi-fi coverage and also works good for wired connections as well.  For the price, the D-Link router is well worth the money.  So why not 5 stars in my rating?  The setup instructions turned out to be useless for me, but may have been because my internet was coming in through a router\/modem combo; multiple routers on a network can cause issues and change how you might access a given router to set it up.  Support is important, especially when you are trying to set up for the first time, but I tried to call and there was a 25 minute wait, so decided to e-mail instead.  That was several days ago and the e-mail has not been answered yet, so I am disappointed in support, so that's one reason I knocked one star off my rating.  I strongly recommend you download the manual from their website, as the unit doesn't come with it.  The manual seems to be well written and comprehensive.  It still didn't help me with setup; I had to figure that out on my own.  If you have a straight-forward setup that is not complicated, you may not have any issues with setting up this unit.  Since this and most routers I have seen only have connections for 4 wired items, I am running an &#34;extension&#34; switch for more network devices and computer.  I could not get it to work at first, until a network expert told me that you have to reboot the router after you connect the switch, in order for it to be recognized."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"just ok","text":"I had the very first kindle...with a red leather first gen case.  I was really excited to get the new hdx 8.9&#34; kindle and a new red leather case.  These origami cases seem like a good idea.  But if you have them sitting on any kind of slightly slick surface or slightly inclined surface, it won't stand up. The function of the &#34;origami&#34; part is a little complicated, but the pictures help.  Initially it is it very stiff and hard to &#34;fold&#34;.  After a few uses it loosens up which makes setting up the &#34;standing&#34; position a little easier, but it still resists the action and as I mentioned, slips.  I was thinking a little rubber edge all around the case edge would help some.  The case &#34;attaches&#34; to the kindle via magnets and turns your kindle on automatically when you open the case, off when up close it.  On the up side, I definitely prefer the feel of the leather case as opposed to the plastic one.  Sadly neither case really functions as it should for standing. However it will provide some protection for the glass which is a pretty good size now.  In addition to the magnet set in, there is are outer power and volume buttons. They are in good locations and I have not hit them accidently. In fact those buttons are quite handy.<br \/>I just wish they'd put more thought into actual function and less into &#34;wow this looks cool&#34; on the stand part.<br \/>Hope this helps some.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Seemed a little slow","text":"I inserted this into a USB 3.0 port and thought it would operate a lot faster than it did.  Speed could be impacted by a lot of things, so maybe shouldn't blame the device.  I did like the fact that it is retractable, so no cap over the end to lose when not inserted.  There is not a lot you can say about a flash drive, as they either work or they don't.  The 64G size is a little small these days and I usually try to only get 128G or higher.  On the other hand, you can't have too many flash drives, as they are very convenient.  I liked the size of this, as some of the newest flash drives are almost too small.  If you don't have tons of data, this is a great backup device."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"good purchase","text":"Lots of research -<br \/>Needed a 47 inch HDTV for living room - old style TV shelves built in to include TV position that was too.<br \/>Based on reviews - caught a quick sales price opportunity and pulled the trigger. So happy with purchase.<br \/>1. Had to search online for the best picture calibration. Out of the box the picture was not good. Comparing it to our LG 60 plasma.<br \/>2. Wanted and LED\/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.<br \/>3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.<br \/>So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.<br \/>TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.<br \/>Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w\/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.<br \/>since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.<br \/><br \/>we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.<br \/><br \/>the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.<br \/><br \/>con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Astonishing Detail, Color in Huge TV Display","text":"The detail that you see with this SAMSUNG QN55Q7F FLAT 55\u201d QLED 4K UHD 7 SERIES SMART TV 2018 is astonishing.  Maybe it\u2019s because of all the colors, or maybe it\u2019s because of the ultra-high-resolution setting, but whatever the reason, I love the picture.  In the TV series \u201cHidden\u201d, which has many dark interior scenes, you can see the color variations in the stone walls, as well as all the furnishings in the darkest corners!<br \/><br \/>IMPORTANT NOTE:  This 55\u201d flat screen TV isn\u2019t particularly heavy (45 lbs.), but it\u2019s very difficult to move because of the huge screen.  You really need two people to lift it onto a TV stand (and probably to mount it on a wall).  I managed to lever it onto a TV stand by myself, but was lucky not to damage it, and wouldn\u2019t want to repeat the experience.<br \/><br \/>SMART TV INTERFACE, TV REMOTE:  The Samsung QLED TV has an interface with all the same settings as my [[ASIN:B00J57IJ0C 2014 Samsung Smart TV]], though of course the settings are relocated, and the TV remote is different.  The remote has no Mute button (you press the volume toggle button for Mute), and no Sources button, but you can access Sources from the onscreen Home hub (navigate to the left until you see Sources).<br \/><br \/>\u201cONE CONNECT\u201d BOX:  The TV is extraordinarily easy to set up.  A single specialized cable connects the TV to the half-shoebox-size \u201cOne Connect\u201d box (15\u00bd\u201d long, 5\u201d wide, 2\u00bd\u201d high).  The One Connect box has all the connectors for your peripherals (e.g., 4 HDMI ports), so you no longer have cables hanging off the sides of your TV!  I love this, but you do need a place for the box.  Mine rests on the TV stand, behind the TV, along with most of the specialized connector cable (coiled up).<br \/><br \/>SETUP:  The TV Setup can be accomplished with the TV remote, or with your smartphone (using the \u201cSamsung SmartThings\u201d app).  Be careful if you need to download the app--a similarly named app that is NOT the Samsung app may come up first at Google Play or the App Store.  The correct Samsung app has the same icon as the one shown on your TV screen.<br \/><br \/>Setup immediately recognized my Comcast cable box (already plugged into the One Connect box), and set up Xfinity automatically.  Much to my surprise, all of the remotes that were set up to work with the older Samsung Smart TV still worked with this new TV.<br \/><br \/>UNPACKING:  The TV comes in a big cardboard box, and it\u2019s held firmly in place by two molded styrofoam blocks.  (One of my blocks was cracked, so the box had probably been dropped, but the TV was undamaged.)  As much as I hate styrofoam, these materials are easier to dispose of than the gazillion little folded cardboard thingies that were inside my older TV\u2019s cardboard box.<br \/><br \/>Be sure to open the top of the box and read the unpacking instructions before you do anything else.  Most of the box lifts straight up off the base that supports the TV.  You don\u2019t have to cut into the box, except to open the top."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Crystal-Clear Protector Goes on Bubble-Free, Doesn't Interfere With Voyage's Haptic Page-Turns","text":"I really love the Moshi iVisor \"black border\" screen protectors.  They go on quickly, and bubble-free, because the protector  is made of stiff plastic (for easy handling), and has adhesive only under the black portions (to avoid trapping dust motes in the backlit part of the screen).  Because the screen protector is stiff, you can pick it up easily for do-overs until you're completely satisfied with the positioning.<br \/><br \/>As other reviewers have noted, this crystal-clear MOSHI IVISOR SCREEN PROTECTOR FOR KINDLE VOYAGE is highly reflective.  I don't like matte-finish screen protectors at all, so I don't mind this.  When I'm reading under a lamp or light source that causes mirror-like reflections, I simply adjust the angle at which I'm holding the Voyage.  (In truth, you don't really need a screen protector for a Kindle Voyage or Paperwhite, if you have a simple case that protects it from scratches, such as the [[ASIN:B00MVUR3DY OMOTON Kindle Voyage Smart Case Cover]], or the [[ASIN:B00IU7CLD4 Incipio Top Folio Cover for Kindle Voyage]]).<br \/><br \/>My biggest concern when I installed this screen protector, was whether the stiff plastic would interfere with the Voyage's haptic page-turn feature.  (A feature that you don't know you need until you experience it.)  Happily, it does NOT.  The Voyage's haptic page-turn continues to work perfectly after the protector goes on.<br \/><br \/>This screen protector took me about 10 minutes to install, including several repositioning do-overs.  If you want to remove the protector for any reason, it leaves no residue behind.  A microfiber cloth for cleaning the screen prior to applying the screen protector is included in the package."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Good Resolution, Wide Range, Easy Setup, Very Slow Response","text":"There is no operating or setup manual with this camera; only a website listed in a very thin brochure.  You go to the website to set up the camera and download a manual, if you need one.  Setup is pretty easy.  I set it up on my computer and then later on my Android smartphone using the free app from Google Play Store.  5 stars for the easy setup procedure once you realize you need to go to the website.  The camera started functioning right away on both the computer and the phone.  The picture resolution was quite good and it does have a decent wide angle.  I didn't test the face recognition feature, as it didn't seem like it would be useful to me.  The main problem I encountered with the camera is the delay between the time the action occurs and the video result; it takes almost 5 seconds for the video to appear.  That's a real problem if you need live action; it's not quite live with the 5 second delay.  The Android phone version was very easy to set up and use.  It could be a nice camera if they can do something about the slow response time.  Also they need to put a little more information into the printed brochure that comes with the camera.  Note that my unit heated up quite a bit after being plugged in for a while.  Not too hot to hold, but warmer than I expected."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"... able to see who is at your door is great, but the Ring Doorbell Pro is not great","text":"The concept of being able to see who is at your door is great, but the Ring Doorbell Pro is not great.  When installing the product, the wire connectors would not accept and lock the wires, I had to purchase different wire connectors.  For the first three days, I kept losing power to the doorbell.  I would have to reinstall it, the wires won't stay connected tightly to the doorbell no matter how tightly the screws are.  I had to put a large amount of electrical tape to keep the screws from loosening and power being lost.<br \/>After that the doorbell worked as it should for approximately 3 weeks, it then started getting knocked offline and needed to be reset continually.  If it was my wi-connection it would make sense that my other gadgets would also be losing their wi-fi connection, but that wasn't the case.  3 weeks ago my video view feed was black, no audio no picture.  I reinstalled the doorbell, but it was a black screen view.  I would get the notice that someone was at the door, but I could view them.  I contacted the Ring customer service.  After several days they replied, had me run some wi-fi diagnostics and send them screen shots.  They said I needed a Ring Pro Chime, because I needed a wi-fi extender.  If it worked okay at the first, why all of a sudden would it not work now?  No response was received back customer service.  I have not received the Ring Pro Chime as I was told I would to correct the problem.  I had an electrician check my power voltage where the doorbell is installed, he said I have the correct voltage according to their instructions.  As of today my doorbell is dead, it doesn't rind, video doesn't even pull up any longer.  This is not a good product and I would not recommend it to anyone.  It has been a waste of time and money."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"A respectable basic HDTV antenna for free public channel reception","text":"I own two rabbit ear antennas:<br \/>- GE Model TV94713 VHF\/UHF\/FM<br \/>- RCA ANT111 Television - Radio - Indoor - FM - VHF - UHF<br \/><br \/>I had replaced my GE Model on one 19\" Vizio HDTV with a Mohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna which turned out to be a superb upgrade. Therefore, when this antenna came up for review, I decided to replace my RCA set-top on my other 19\" Vizio HDTV for this non-amplified Amazon Basics HDTV antenna.<br \/><br \/>I live in northwestern NJ around 30 miles from NYC. In this area, my RCA gave me around 45 channels but in order to get those channels, I had to constantly adjust the antenna to bring in some stations.  After running the automatic channel scan, this Amazon Basics Antenna gives me 44 channels. In fact, a few of the channels I now receive appear to be different than the ones I received before because I do not recognize the call letters.<br \/><br \/>The PROS are:<br \/><br \/>- Installation was so simple. I attached the coax cable on the antenna to the antenna port on the back of my HDTV. Since the coax cable is very long, I was able to run the cable up the wall and across a shelf and then let it hang on the other side.<br \/><br \/>- I no longer have to adjust the antenna to bring in the channels.<br \/><br \/>- The antenna is like a flat piece of cardboard which I can tape up if I want to. Two double-side 3M Command Brand Strips are provided for this purpose.  Personally I would not use this because if I want to adjust the reception, I'd have to remove the antenna from its permanent location.<br \/><br \/>- The instructions are easy to understand.<br \/><br \/>The CONS are:<br \/><br \/>- The user pamphlet says to run a channel scan every month after the initial scan; however, the quick start guide says to run a scan every time you re-position the antenna after the initial scan.  Let's just say, I won't be doing this unless I have problems with receiving a particular channel.<br \/><br \/>- The one big negative for me is that the picture quality is not as vibrant as with the RCA rabbit-ear antenna I used previously.  I do realize this is not an amplified antenna, but I did expect the picture quality to be equivalent to the RCA rabbit-ear I replaced and it is not. The colors appear to be washed out for most channels and the reception is closer on those channels to a \"dot pixel\" image rather than a vibrant image. For this reason, I consider this antenna to be just okay. However, I will continue to use this over my RCA because I don't have to adjust this antenna to get all the channels I sometimes view.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, the current low price of $20.24 makes this a respectable choice if money is an issue. However, if a vibrant picture quality is most important, I would recommend looking into a Mohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna (or equivalent) even though the cost is a little over three times the price.<br \/><br \/>Also, it seems antennas for some are hit or miss depending on the area one lives in. The Amazon Basics user pamphlet recommends you check for a list of channels available in your area.  I put the URL in the comments section for those who are interested.<br \/><br \/>BUYER BEWARE Update 11\/26\/13 - This review is for the Amazon Basics Ultra Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna and not the High Performance or Extreme Performance Amplified Antennas.  Based on a comment someone made to this review, I discovered that Amazon is posting a review for any one of these antennas as a review for each of the invidiual ones.  Those other antennas may be better than the one I reviewed.  Please make sure the review you are reading applies to the antenna you are considering for purchase and if you are unsure, you might ask the reviewer to clarify that for you.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 11\/27\/13 - Another commenter pointed out that Amazon lists the item reviewed below my name in the review. I checked this out and that is correct. So another way to tell what item is being reviewed is to look at the tags below my name."}
{"rating":1.0,"title":"Junk","text":"I can only assume that most of the positive reviews are referring to a different product than the Uncle Milton 3D Star Theater that I got. There is no wide angle starry background as shown in the video.  There is no AC adapter or an input for one. There is no open tray feature or a way to change the one disc (I assume) inside it. It came with English instructions and a supplementary instruction sheet that was in Arabic I think. The images are marginally viewable on a white surface 3 to 5 feet away in a completely dark room. You have to rotate across the images manually of which there are only 8.  The optics are poor the images are blurry even after focusing. The light is extremely dim. And it rattles.  Very poor product. Definitely returning this one for a refund."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Not too happy with this purchase","text":"OK, first the pros. The price was very reasonable and knowing that it was low priced I did not expect it to perform like a $1,000 TV. Also, it was easy to set up. It was easy to pick up and place on my stand. Also, the legs were easy to attach. All I had to do was get a Phillips screwdriver and screw in four screws. Also, it looks sleek and modern. And I like having three HDMI ports which is rare for a set in this price range. It's good that it has both analogue and digital audio outputs as well.<br \/><br \/>Now the cons. First of all, I don't like they way you have to change inputs. On my old TV all I had to do was press one button on the remote and toggle through the inputs. But on this one you have to first hit the input button on the remote, then you have to press one of the arrow keys on the remote until the input you want is highlighted, then press the OK button. That process is way too cumbersome.<br \/><br \/>Secondly, I am not satisfied with the picture quality. Since I got it yesterday I have been trying to adjust the color settings to get the picture the way I want it but I just can't seem to get it right. What really irritates me is skin tones. Fair skinned people look like they have a bright white light shining on their face. Also, dark scenes such as at nighttime are too dark and it's hard to make out anything. Adjusting the brightness settings helps somewhat, but then when the scene changes to daytime it is much too bright so I have to turn the brightness down again.<br \/><br \/>I am debating whether to send it back. I hate to have to try to put it back in its box and then ship it back to Amazon. I think I will wait a few days to see if I can get the picture right. I will update this review after I decide what to do."}

Two minor issues with this drive.  It doesn't have a conventional USB plug.  Instead it looks like a little 3-contact connector.  At first I wondered how I would insert it into my USB port.  Believe me it does go in, but one problem I had was which direction to insert it.  It fits into one side of a USB connection in either direction.  In one direction it works of course and one it doesn't.  The other problem is that the connection hides under a little bendable rubber piece and my USB ports are recessed, so I couldn't bend the rubber enough to easily insert it.  If you want a very tiny storage unit that works great, this is for you.  I have always had excellent results with any Verbatim products too and I full trust their quality and reliability."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Amazing","text":"These are without doubt the best headphones I've ever owned.  The sound quality is incredible- rich and full without over-emphasizing any part of the sound spectrum.  Bass is amazing and brain scrambling.  Mid range is clear and precise and not at all obscured by the lower and upper registers.  Highs are crisp and clear.<br \/>When I put them on for the first time, the fit was comfortable.  They are very good at blocking outside sounds.  The first music I found on my IPod that I wanted to hear was Dvorak's 9th Symphony.  Wonderful.  Instruments were distinct and clear.  Horns sounded rich and full.  A little Springsteen and the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper confirmed that these phones will handle a broad range of musical styles.  Sgt. Pepper was the album that made an audiophile of me back in the 60's when it was released.  At that time, I had a cheap portable stereo with a tilt out turntable and fold out speakers.  I wore out Sgt Pepper on that thing, and then, a friend happened to have it playing on his parents' high end Marantz receiver and impressive speakers when I stopped by one day.  I heard things from that music on his system that I had never heard on my cheap stereo, and I was hooked.  These phones at less than  a hundred dollars give me everything I heard on that high end system all those years ago.  I've seen headphones listing for a hell of a lot more, and I can't imagine that they can sound that much better than these Sony's to justify spending several times more for them.  I consider these to be an incredible bargain worth every penny."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"\"Getting Started in Under 5 Minutes\" Is No Lie!","text":"The JABRA STEALTH BLUETOOTH HEADSET guide is titled \"Getting Started in Under 5 Minutes\"--and the guide does not lie.  The basic setup took me less than 5 minutes, even though I had zero prior experience using a Bluetooth headset paired with a cellphone.  And in under 15 minutes, I had voice dialing activated (a feature that depends on your phone), so that I could use the headset to place and end calls with voice commands transmitted to my phone (a Samsung Galaxy S4).<br \/><br \/>My Jabra Stealth headset seemed to need a brief charge (a USB\/MicroB cable is included) prior to accomplishing a Bluetooth pairing.  However, I may not have been pressing the Answer\/End phone call button correctly at first, to activate pairing--the \"button\" is actually a long silver piece with mic holes, that moves up and down when you press the \"Jabra\" marking.  Once the flashing Bluetooth indicator light appeared, my phone found the Jabra headset immediately, paired with it, and connected.  I can also use NFC to quickly connect my phone with the headset.<br \/><br \/>The headset charges completely in about two hours, which gives you about six hours of talk time.  Once it's even partially charged, a pleasant female voice announces how much talk time is available when you turn the headset on.  The headset is so lightweight, it's barely noticeable when you're wearing it.  You do want to experiment a little with the included selection of ear gels and ear hooks, to find the one that fits your ear most comfortably.  You can wear this headset in either the right or left ear.<br \/><br \/>I would recommend visiting the Jabra Stealth web site, to watch a short instructional video, look over the FAQs, and download the Jabra Stealth User Manual (a .pdf file).  The .pdf manual is slightly more complete than the Getting Started guide, and has an additional section on \"Handling Multiple Calls\" (you can place a call on hold).  The FAQs tell you how to set up the Jabra Stealth headset to work with two different mobile devices (but only one device will be able to use voice-activated dialing).<br \/><br \/>I like this headset a lot, and plan to use it for answering calls handsfree when I'm driving. The sound quality is very good.  You have to use the volume controls on your mobile phone, because there are none on the headset itself, but I'm happy enough with that tradeoff in return for such a small, lightweight headset."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fast, Responsive Memory Cards","text":"I haven\u2019t used these PNY 16GB ELITE CLASS10 U1 FLASH MEMORY CARDS (2-Pack, up to 85MB\/s Read Speed) for long enough to know how reliable they are over time.  (Some reviews of other PNY memory cards say that the cards stopped working after a few months.)<br \/><br \/>However, the memory cards are fine for my purposes, because I only use them to transfer scanned files from my all-in-one wireless printer to my desktop PC.  (For some reason, the wireless printer won\u2019t connect wirelessly to the PC, and it\u2019s easier to transfer files via a memory card than to troubleshoot the connection.)  Should the memory cards fail unexpectedly--and they haven\u2019t, in my experience--there will be no significant loss of files because I\u2019ll know immediately if my PC can\u2019t read the scanned files.<br \/><br \/>These memory cards have the advantage of being quite inexpensive (about $10 for two cards on Amazon).  They also write very fast, and respond very quickly to file requests."}

A couple of days later it rained (installed it on our garage) and both cameras quick working right, one filled up with water and the other the alarm kept going off with nothing in sight. called Lorex and all they said was, we should have had it under cover, which is not mentioned in instructions. These are the rudest customer service people ever, don't expect help from them. We were told to pay to ship it back and if they didn't think it was our fault. they would then decide to replace it.

I love that it comes with the interchangeable iPhone\/Android tips, making it that much more versatile - but I'll be honest, it comes with a TON more tips that I know I'll never use.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Once I got past the installation and no documentation nightmare; I fell in love with this tablet","text":"I purchased this at the end of July 2014 along with:<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:B00E5NOXM4 Google Nexus 7 2013 Case - Poetic Google Nexus 7 2013 Case [Slimline Series] - [Lightweight] [Ultra-slim] PU Leather Slim-Fit Trifold Cover Stand Folio Case for Google Nexus 7 2nd Gen 2013 Black (3 Year Manufacturer Warranty From Poetic)]]<br \/><br \/>[[ASIN:B008MOHLVC Stylus, amPen\u00ae Hybrid Stylus (Black) for Apple iPad Air\/iPad 2\/iPad Mini, Apple iPhone 6 (4.7)\/6 Plus (5.5)\/5\/5s\/5c\/4s, Nexus 5\/7, Galaxy Tab 4\/3\/2, Galaxy S5\/S4, HTC One M8\/M7 (Interchangeable Hybrid Tip Feature)]].<br \/><br \/>I also  ordered the [[ASIN:1937842282 Google Nexus 7 (Android 4.4 KitKat Edition)]] book as a compliment to this purchase.<br \/><br \/>I waited almost six months to write this review because I wanted to \"cool off\" from my installation experience that would have caused me to rate this 3 stars. I am also now able to fairly assess this tablet after a few months' use.<br \/><br \/>I wanted a highly-rated unrestricted (open) tablet that provided great graphics and sufficient screen space. I purchased this to use on a Wi-Fi network only for when I didn't want to boot up my laptop to check mail or see a movie, etc.  I also did not want an Apple tablet because my boyfriend has an iPad 3 and the Apple products have restrictions. I also was not impressed with the graphics on his iPad.  I was considering a Kindle Fire HD 7\" but that tablet was too restrictive as well and was geared to Amazon junkies. I am an Amazon junkie but I also do not like restrictions on products I purchase.  During my July 2014 research, I discovered that the Nexus 7 tablet was the highest rated Android next to those more restrictive tablets.<br \/><br \/>After I received the Nexus, I wondered if I had made the right decision.  First, I was surprised that this came with no documentation (other than the business card sized diagram of where all the ports were and a warranty and safety agreement in both English and French).  The documentation didn't even say how long I needed to charge the unit.  I charged it overnight and then had immense trouble getting this connected.<br \/><br \/>The router I was connecting to has MAC filtering enabled so I needed the MAC address.  However, I couldn't get the MAC address without setting up the device. Also, I couldn't set it up because I couldn't get the MAC address.  I could have fussed with the router and turned off MAC filtering\/security temporarily but I had to get to work in the morning right after the unit completed charging.  I then tried connecting via three other networks (my library for one, my work another, and another Wi-Fi connection).  It still would not connect. Because I didn't want to wait until I got home 12 hours later to fuss with my router I wound up asking a tech support person where I work. He connected me via his personal MiFi mobile hotspot.<br \/><br \/>Apparently, Google Nexus only connects to certain networks if the first time setup has not been done.  I tried several open networks. My co-worker's MiFi mobile network connection, although I suspect mine would have connected had I temporarily removed the security on my router, was the only one that would allow me to run the automatic setup so that I could connect.  After setup was performed, I was able to get the MAC address from the settings \"about\" tab.  I was also able to connect to the three other networks I tried previously and after inputting the MAC address, I could also connect to my router.  It was apparently the initial setup process that prevented the connection.<br \/><br \/> This Google Nexus would have gotten five stars if they enhanced the user experience by:<br \/>1 - Providing a MAC address either on the unit or on a piece of paper for those that have MAC filtering enabled.<br \/>2 - Providing a documentation pamphlet with the unit that:<br \/>* Tells the user how long they need to charge the unit the first time.<br \/>* Explains to the user that setup cannot be run on all networks and sometimes they will get an error message.  Therefore, they might say something like \"using your own network is advisable\" or provide an explanation of why certain networks (including totally open ones that allow all connections) would not work.  Perhaps there is some sort of technical protocol that is not available on all networks; I have no idea.<br \/><br \/>Other than the above, I absolutely love my Google Nexus.  I've been using this for almost 6 months and it has met my every expectation. It charges in less than four hours; lasts about 3 hours if I'm constantly using it; lasts about 3-4 days when I'm using it for about 10 minutes daily. I've used this for email, movies, web surfing, pictures, etc. App availability is unending (Kindle, LinkedIn, Battery Doctor, etc., etc.)  I tested the screen image next to my co-workers Kindle Fire HD 7\" and there is no discernible difference in quality or resolution.  Images and movies on this device are superb. If I attach my [[ASIN:B00N4SIIFY APLWL USB 2.0 A to Micro B Cable 6FT-TPE jacket-Blue]] to my laptop, I can both charge the unit and also access files on it from my laptop such as the photos located under Nexus 7\\Internal storage\\DCIM\\Camera directory (that's Computer\\Nexus 7\\Internal storage\\DCIM\\Camera in Explorer).<br \/><br \/>Overall this is a quality tablet that did not disappoint me once I got past the initial installation and lack of documentation headache. In the comments section of my review, I put links to Google documentation I found helpful as well as to the 2014 review I used for my research.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE Jan 6, 2015 - Right after I wrote this review I had a problem where my Nexus was shutting down automatically and every time I went to use it I had to power it back up.  After doing an Internet search I was able to fix this by going to the Play Store app on the Nexus, then selecting \"My Apps\" and accepting all install updates.  There were a few updates that had not installed and this was playing havoc with my system. After I did this, the Nexus remained powered up and has been working fine the last several days."}

My husband was always having to tell them to switch WiFi routers. We've been using this router for about three weeks now and we have not had any trouble at all. We are keeping it located on the main floor in the living room. It easily reaches the bedrooms upstairs and the far corners of the basement. This can be used as a gateway or an extender. We are using it as an extender with our Comcast gateway to give us the WiFi throughout the house. If you don't have a gateway, It can be both a gateway and provide the WiFi too if you need it. Our Comcast gateway does not have WiFi. The strength of the signal has been full. It is amazing how much better this is performing. Our daughter has not complained once about not having any WiFi signal. It is larger than our previous routers. We have it positioned behind the TV in the living room on the entertainment stand. The speed has been great. We use anywhere from 7 devices to 12 at any one time. And if the kids have friends over, that number is more. My husband is a programmer and works at home a few days a week.

It was quick and easy enough for her to pair without instructions, and the sound was good and robust (not \"canny,\" as I feared).

Which is really nice in that regard.<br \/><br \/>The light also has a red, blue, and a red-blue flashing setting, which is useful for signaling danger\/attention. It's made of stainless steel and aluminum and feels very sturdy. It weighs 1 lb 3 oz.<br \/><br \/>It took me a while to figure out how to charge the battery: the charging port is on the battery structure (i.e., you have to unscrew the back, take out the batteries, and the charging port is on the bottom of the battery structure).<br \/><br \/>Overall a great light that I would recommend."}

This was bought as a replacement lamp for a nightstand. My hubby has to use a cpap machine at night which takes up a lot of space on his nightstand. It\u2019s not bright enough to read a book by even on its highest level.<br \/>  The color changing mode is nice to have at night but it needs to be charged a couple times a week. At first I was a bit disappointed, but with the added time, radio and alarm features, it was worth the money. It could be brighter though and the battery could last a bit longer."}

I have had four routers in my life (the E4200 being the fifth) and only the Linksys router gave me headaches.  I vowed to never get another Linksys in my life, but I like Cisco so this was a dilemna and so far I am have been happy with it.<br \/><br \/>Design<br \/><br \/>This is a very slick device.  I love the low profile that lets it hide on top of the cabinet it is on.  A nice looking piece of hardware.<br \/><br \/>Setup<br \/><br \/>I have never had an easier set up on any wireless router.  I installed the software onto my MacBook (mac friendly) and it self-discovered and prompted for the rest of the set up.  Very nice setup, although a little long from beginning to end (7 minutes or so.)  I loved that it prompted to personalize the SSID and password right up front.  Software was slick and straight forward.  Once set up I had all 7 wireless devices in the house on-line in about 20 minutes. Even my wireless printer worked instantly. - Five stars on Set-up<br \/><br \/>Functionality<br \/><br \/>I have only had the device installed for a weekend now, but I spent that time backing up my hard drive to a wireless SAN, watching streaming netflix and uploading a new website.  No hiccups at all.  About the only thing I did have an issue with is trying to set it up with my Ooma.  I needed to rebooted the router and modem after removing the Ooma.  No blame here, the Ooma doesn't seem to want to play nicely with any router or cable modem.<br \/><br \/>I really like the ability to have a guest network.  It is easily turned off and on so I can easily provide a connection to visitors, but turn it off and totally deny the Brazilian students next door (actually it is password protected so it is not wide open, but less secure.)<br \/><br \/>Speed<br \/><br \/>I may not be the best to judge speed.  I am not the type to watch the throughput numbers, but I can say that netflix streamed Mars Attacks wirelessly to my Wii without any issues. I have no issues with the speed at all.<br \/><br \/>Conclusion<br \/><br \/>I am very happy with the router.  Who knows, two years down the line, I may be able to let my prejudice against Linksys go.  If things continue to go well, or if they take a turn for the worse, I will update this review."}

Sleek, attractive and would probably delight any techie who is looking for some kind of new hip gadget. For the cons: It's too small. There are no indentations to grip the mouse and it is difficult to click on any area that you are trying to. Navigation\/movement of the mouse is ok, it's the clicking that is difficult to do (and it becomes quite annoying to say the least). Within using this for a full day I, unfortunately, reverted back to my old wireless HP mouse. Maybe I am just old school and set in my ways (I am in my 50's), so I will be 'loaning' this to my techie son to give it a go.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Another Great Flip Product","text":"I purchased my first Flip Camcorder about a year and a half ago when I was planning my trip to Ireland. I bought a 60 minute basic Flip and was pleasantly surprised how easy it was to use and the great quality of the video. The only downside I saw with the original was the fact that it was only 60 minutes. Enter the new Flip UltraHD Camcorder which has a 120 minute capability. When I first received it, I couldn't wait to try it out. The quality of the video is beautiful and the HD capability really makes a huge difference in my pictures. I love the fact that the camera is smaller than my original camera and that I know can film up to 120 minutes. When I took the camera to Ireland, I found that a 60 minute recording just couldn't be used for a day's worth of sightseeing. I found myself taking short snippets, afraid that I would use up the entire capability until I was able to get back to the hotel and offload the recording. The short vignettes really came across choppy and I was yearning for a larger capacity. This 120 minute model, besides having better resolution, allows me the ability to take the camera with me full day to record. I haven't seen the problem with battery life yet (as I have seen others comment on), so I can't say anything negative. I just love my new Flip and I highly recommend it for any one planning to take a vacation this year. It fits neatly into my pocket and has the capacity and quality that I am looking for!"}
{"rating":1.0,"title":"Troublesome - Updating Old Review","text":"Initially I had problems setting up the printer to use wirelessly.  It was taking so long that something seemed wrong, so tried to cancel.  The cancel went on for hours, so had to reboot.  After reboot, the setup for wireless was done in 5 minutes, so probably was just a problem with my system rather than with the printer.  Seems like a decent printer with reasonable speed and reasonable color print quality.  It's not photo print quality, but more than adequate quality for most color printing needs.  Comes with 4 color cartridges so you can replace just one color when that color runs out.  Some color printers used to come with only 2 (black & color).  When any one color ran out you had to buy a new color cartridge.  Most manufacturers have moved away from that and this is a good thing.<br \/><br \/>Note that you can also use a USB connection if you don't want to use wireless.  This is not a huge hulking printer, so fits nicely in small places and with the wireless capability you can put it in a location somewhat away from the computer.  HP seems to make quality products and I am confident that you can't go wrong buying this printer.<br \/><br \/>My initial reactions were above, but we had a lot of trouble with ink cartridges on this printer.  Hardly any printing and the cartridges were empty or the printer thought they were.  Replaced all the cartridges and it worked.  Then tried to print again a few weeks later and it is saying that two of the cartridges are empty.  They can't be this soon with only having printed a few pages.  Got the cartridges straightened out and now it says there is no paper in the printer, but there is.  I tried loading and reloading paper multiple times, but no luck.  This is a very troublesome printer and I think it is going to go into the junk pile now.  Too bad, as HP makes some things very well (or used to).  I have an HP scanner I have had for years and have had about 4 HP laptops, which were built very ruggedly.  Their older laptops were built like tanks and they last and last.  I guess you can't make everything well.  I am doing with HP color printers for now, unless the quality improves."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Rugged and sturdy but still pretty flexible","text":"I really like this monitor stand.  We ended up putting it onto one of our son's gaming work station to up the coolness level and let him maneuver his monitor around and it does both great.  I spent some time fretting over how to install it before it came and found that all my concerns were met by the product.  I was concerned that I was not going to be able to install it from the back of the desk which is built into the wall, but with the grommet mount, we were able to bore a grommet hole and have it look great.  I was also wondering how to attach the monitor to the mount, but the mounting plate can be removed, installed, then slipped back on the arm easily.  This is very well engineered. It is pretty much invisible with the monitor installed and put a little forward.<br \/><br \/>As for manufacturing, this thing is solid.  It is surprisingly heavy when you get it the box and that translates to solid parts.  It is rock solid.  Add that to the well engineered design and you have a great product.  I can't judge by price because at this point it is unavailable and no price is listed.  But I would rank it with the upper half of monitor arms.<br \/><br \/>The only limitation I see, and it is small, is that you cannot adjust the height up and down easily, you will need to move it up and down the post, so you kind of need to decide on the height and keep it there.  My desk has a arm that allows you to move it up and down as well, this one doesn't, but if that limitation is fine you have plenty of side to side, in and out and tilt controls.<br \/><br \/>All in all, very happy with this monitor mount."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Mixed Feelings","text":"I'm usually a fan of Netgear products. I'm always happy to get free loot from the brand. Unfortunately, I have very mixed feelings about this switch. I think the worst thing is that you are basically pushed into installing an app that requires a paid subscription. That should be made crystal clear in the messaging before you even waste your time and effort with the app. I don't understand why the subscription is necessary in the first place considering that this device isn't at the level that it requires one. My other gripe is the size of the power supply. I think it's too large in comparison to the size of the switch itself. I think the switch itself is fine, but the overall package needs improvement. This is a rare miss for the brand.<br \/><br \/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.  I hope the information that I've provided helps make your decision a little easier."}

Since I have purchased them (8.99 for FOUR pairs) I have NOT lost my earbuds once! These are comfortable and easily taken off and put back on since the case will not close with them on.

The drive itself is approx 5:x4\"x 3\/4\".  It is black and has a little flashing light when it's being used.  I had things sorted on my Hopper in \"files\".  So far, I cannot figure out how to make folders on the hard drive, so everything is just mixed on the hard drive - that means looking thru about 200 titles - Eh - but the point of the hard drive for us is to save the content if we have to replace the Hopper at some point.  It is easy to move the files back and forth.. And you can play the movies from the hard drive.  It did take quite a while to transfer, we had about 50% of our Hopper memory - a number of hours.  But no biggee to me.  So far, I am happy with my purchase, however, time will tell.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."}

The problem is that even after having it for a couple of months, reading and rereading the instruction book, I still can't program it to wake me, either by radio (which I prefer) or the buzzer. The alarm was really the main reason for the purchase. My other clock radio finally gave out after many years and I thought this would be a great, updated replacement.  My husband worked on it for a couple of hours and didn't get much further than I.  I really love the time projection on the ceiling or wall. It provides a lot of information and options, but it's not easy to set up.  If I still had the packaging, I would have sent it back, but I never imagined it would be such a challenge, and I threw the box, et al., away.

It has manual zoom and the ability to remove keystoning.  the throw is not horribly long, but works in most rooms.  For us we hooked it up to a PS4 to play Rocketball on a wall.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A rollicking adventure through the African jungle","text":"It has to be said: although I'm a twentysomething, I still *love * to watch Nickelodeon cartoons, my absolute favourite being \"The Wild Thornberrys.\" I've seen every episode (many more than once), and I was a little skeptical at the thought of a full-length animated movie.<br \/>Happily, the movie far surpassed my wildest expectations. The animation looks great, including the use of several CGI elements not present in the series (at some moments it reminded me of \"The Lion King\"). There is enough background information included (including the opening credits of the series) that newcomers won't feel left behind. The whole Thornberry gang is here, including the addition of Nigel's parents, and several new characters as well. The voice work is fantastic, including such well-known names as Tim Curry as Nigel, Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea as Donnie, Rupert Everett as the baddie, and Marisa Tomei. The music is an eclectic mix of traditional and modern, featuring such talents as Sting, Dave Matthews, P. Diddy and Brandy, Youssou D'Nour, Sting, Baha Men, Nick Carter, Peter Gabriel and Hugh Masekela.<br \/>The story finds Eliza Thornberry, a twelve-year old with the magical ability to talk to animals, on a hunt for migrating elephants with her family, who are award-winning naturalists. Eliza's older sister Debbie is a moody, pop culture-obsessed Valley Girl who hates all the wilderness trekking. Donnie is the Bornean wild boy that the Thornberrys adopted, who is always causing trouble by making messes and stuffing things up his nose or down his pants. Darwin is Eliza's best friend, a chimpanzee with very human tastes, including his obsession with Cheese Munchies. Eliza starts out playing with the cubs of a cheetah friend, but when one of them is stolen by a poacher Eliza must rescue him. However, her parents send her to a London boarding school, where Eliza is miserable and doesn't fit in. The rest of the movie you'll have to see to believe!<br \/>There are some scary chase scenes, wounded animals and tense moments that might upset younger viewers, but overall \"The Thornberrys Movie\" does an excellent job of bringing the show to the big screen while remaining faithful to the humour, excellent ethnic music, and magical elements of the original series. One of the things that I love the most about the \"Wild Thornberrys\" is that the episodes take viewers all around the world, and the show's producers try to avoid ethnic stereotypes with the various characters, as well as adding authentic music and traditions. This is one cartoon that is witty, educational and downright fun for the whole family. There's something for everyone with \"The Wild Thornberrys Movie.\""}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fast!","text":"I have been using laptops for the past 30 years, and haven\u2019t bought a new one since 2013.  It was a special treat getting this new DELL G3. I\u2019m not a crazy gamer, but I do play games. I was attracted to this computer because I wanted performance, and I know gamers expect high performance!<br \/>PROS:<br \/>-FAST FAST FAST. It is by far the fastest computer I\u2019ve ever owned. I often blamed my speed on my Internet connection -- but am now discovering that my computer itself was at least 75% of the  problem.<br \/>-The graphics card is amazing!  My 10yr old nephew tried out Minecraft, Java Edition on my laptop. He gave it a 98\/100.  The Frames Per Second rate started around 90+.  He gave it the TNT test (a fast animation to stress out the frame rate) and the frame rate dropped 30 then immediately recovered to the high level.<br \/>-The keyboard glows blue. Not only is it super cool, it\u2019s easy to see in low light.<br \/>-Compared to other laptops I\u2019ve had, this one is MUCH cooler (ie you can actually put it on your lap without burning your legs!). Yay for thermal cooling!<br \/>-Great battery life. So far, I have had zero issues with battery life. According to the battery icon, a full battery should last about 5 hours - which I fully believe.<br \/>-The power cord has a blue light where it plugs into the computer so you KNOW it\u2019s charging!<br \/>CONS:<br \/>-It\u2019s heavier than any laptop I\u2019ve had - I assume because of the robustness of the machine.<br \/>-The power supply is HUGE - Again, I have to assume because of the robustness of the computer, but it seems unnecessarily large.<br \/>-For me personally, the keyboard is different than I\u2019m used to.  It has a numeric keypad on the right end of the keyboard -- so the QWERTY keys are not as central as I\u2019m used to. There are raised bits on the F&J so you can find home base, and on the center of the number pad, which is good. I think this will just take some getting used to the change.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I\u2019m elated by this laptop.  After having it for about 3 weeks, I have no regrets thus far."}

This newer model has some nice improvements. First of all, the screen is larger. That's always a plus when you're my age. The screen can be tilted too. Another improvement is the screen quality. After setting this up, I immediately \"portaled\" (we use it as a verb now) with my sister. She and her husband said things looked much clearer and sharper on their end. I think they have a 2nd generation. This one was easy to set up and start using. It's easy to move from room to room or outside. The sound quality is good. I am thrilled to have this one!"}

However, the bag pictured on the Amazon\u00a0site differs from the one I received. The one on the site has an outside zippered pocket in front as well as a shoulder strap. It also looks like a better or more richer bag. It is for this reason alone, that this gets 2 stars.<br \/><br \/>The bag I received has two sides. The laptop compartment has a nicely padded folder pocket. Even though this is only supposed to fit up to 16\" laptops, I had no problem fitting my 17\" HP Omen Laptop which has a very slim profile. Besides the laptop sleeve there are two mesh pockets on the opposite side. On the laptop side, there is not much that can be held beside the laptop. However, the other side of the bag unzips a few inches and there is an additional compartment there with four mesh pockets and one full size folder pocket. There is enough room on this side to carry some folders or pads.\u00a0<br \/><br \/>Therefore, this laptop carrier can expand as needed if carrying more than just a laptop.\u00a0There is no pencil or pens sleeves but I do not feel that is needed.\u00a0The zippers glide easily around as long as no creases are in the way.\u00a0 \u00a0<br \/><br \/>In summary, the bag I received looks like a cheaper and scaled down version of the one pictured on the Amazon site.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Not bad, but could have been better","text":"Got this MP3 player as part of the Amazon Vine program. My older Ipod was just about ready to be replaced, so I thought that this would be a good alternative. Well, sound quality is really good, which I liked. Earbuds, as has been mentioned in other reviews, are far superior to the ones that come standard from the Ipod. I didn't like the screen display, too small for these 50 year old eyes. All in all, it's ok, which is why I gave it 4 stars. It does what it needs to do. But, to be honest, if I was going to spend $140 on an MP3 player, I would much rather go with the Apple. Seems that, although their store is a monopoly, it's much easier to get music using the Apple and the screen size (and now camera capabilities) are far superior on the Ipod. I am still using the Phillips and will until it needs to be replaced again (and then I will opt back to Apple)."}

Padding: quality -  on the backpack straps and particularly the section directly meant for the computer<br \/>4. Compartments: although the pictures do not necessarily show this, there are zippers on the outside, and inside, a pocket with divisions for pencils\/pens\/highlighters.<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/>1. Backpack adjustable straps: are on the lower part not allowing for easy adjustment while on your back<br \/>2. Lower connection backpack straps: hidden - cannot see whether sewn in well or not<br \/>3. Strap to hold computer in place: oddly long, which would allow for movement and sliding around, something you don't want your computer to do when inside<br \/>4. No compartment\/pocket for a water bottle (my pet peeve)<br \/>5. PRIMARY (HUGE) ISSUE: Backpack straps which rest on upper trapezoids (left and right) are situated in a very uncomfortable position when fully loaded.  I'm unsure if it's the angle or the placement, but the straps are too close to your neck and would cause pain.  Primarily for this reason, I'm returning the backpack.  Sad because even with the other cons (more annoyances than anything else) if it were not for this one, I would've kept the backpack because the pros outweigh the cons.<br \/><br \/>Pictures: It's important to see how a backpack will perform in my daily life.  Therefore, the pictures provide a sense of how much stuff this can carry, with the contents both packed and unpacked.<br \/><br \/>Contents: Lenovo ThinkPad T460 in neoprene case, keys, 1 1\/2&#34; loose-leaf binder, yearly planner, scientific calculator, computer power cord, small cosmetic case, large cosmetic bag which houses pens\/pencils\/highlighters\/usb drive\/mouse\/headphones and wallet.<br \/><br \/>Final thoughts: if only used as a briefcase\/shoulder bag, this may be for you.  However, if the primary purpose is to function as a backpack, good luck.  I think another reviewer mentioned the oddly-placed backpack straps, but sadly, I ignored that advice.<br \/>In addition, cannot ascertain the strength of the shoulder strap as I didn't want to break the seal, but it is pictured."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent HD Recordings Suit My Needs Perfectly","text":"This MOTOROLA MDC100 FULL HD (1080p) DASH CAMERA (Black) suits my needs perfectly.  It\u2019s mounted on the windshield, behind the rear view mirror, with an extremely strong suction cup.  The suction cup is made of something that sticks to the windshield, and a ring tightens the suction cup so that it really, really sticks.  The dash camera itself plugs into your car\u2019s repurposed \u201ccigarette lighter\u201d outlet, and video recording turns on automatically when you start your car.<br \/><br \/>The camera requires a micro SD card (not included) for recording the video of your auto trips.  I installed a [[ASIN:B00M55C0NS SanDisk 32GB card]] (the maximum size), and filled about 15-20% of the card with an hour\u2019s driving.  So the maximum size should record for 5-6 hours before it starts recording over the oldest recordings.  The camera\u2019s internal software allows you to \u201cprotect\u201d designated recordings (or still photos) if you don\u2019t want them to be recorded over.<br \/><br \/>Using an adapter, I inserted the micro SD card into a Windows 10 PC, and the PC was able to play the .avi videos without any problems at all.  I also deleted selected videos that I made while learning to use the settings.  The camera has a \u201cdelete\u201d function, but it\u2019s easier to use a PC for deleting selected files.<br \/><br \/>The camera has three modes--recording, photo, and replay. In photo mode, you can take still photos; in replay mode, you can look at your recordings and photos.  You can replay the videos at various speeds (up to 8x maximum).  You can also fast forward and fast rewind your videos as you replay them.<br \/><br \/>The camera takes excellent high-definition footage when it\u2019s set to the highest (default) setting.  The camera\u2019s on\/off functions for both power and recording are a bit confusing at first, so I strongly recommend that you sit down with the camera and familiarize yourself with all the settings and features before you install it in your vehicle.  Of course, the camera is easy to uninstall\/reinstall if you want to leave that step for later.<br \/><br \/>One very important thing to know is that if you turn recording off manually (by hitting the OK button) for any reason, you must turn recording on again manually when you\u2019re done with Settings or whatever made you turn recording off.  Otherwise the camera won\u2019t start recording automatically when you start your car.<br \/><br \/>The camera has a built in battery for holding the settings and powering the camera while the vehicle is parked.  I didn't test the Park function, which is disabled by default, because I don't like to leave an electronic device in plain sight when I'm going to be away from my car for a while.  The battery can be used to replay videos or to look at photos, but it doesn't last long when used this way."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Easiest Setup Ever Encountered; Works With Samsung QLED Smart TV","text":"This AMAZON BASICS WIRELESS KEYBOARD (with Touchpad for Smart TV - US Layout (QWERTY)) has the easiest setup I\u2019ve ever encountered for a wireless device.  You insert 2 AAA batteries (included) into the keyboard, plug the USB radio receiver into a USB port on your Smart TV, and you\u2019re instantly connected.  If for some reason you aren\u2019t automatically connected, you just hit Esc-K to connect.<br \/><br \/>The keyboard works with my Samsung QLED Q7F Smart TV.  Not all of the function keys work with every screen--for example, the keyboard\u2019s \u201cMute\u201d button does NOT mute the TV--but that\u2019s normal for generic controllers like this one that are intended to work with many different wireless devices.<br \/><br \/>The keyboard does everything that my Samsung remote does (for example, switches between apps, sources, calls up the TV settings menu), although it takes a bit of experimentation to learn how to use it.  The direction keys near the touchscreen allow you to navigate the TV screen and everything else.  If you go to the TV\u2019s Internet area, the touchscreen activates and you see a big arrow cursor that works like a mouse.<br \/><br \/>The keyboard does the one thing that I really wanted. It has a Search button that allows me to search for TV shows, movies, etc. by typing on the keyboard, instead of by navigating around letter-by-letter on an onscreen letterpad.  The keyboard does NOT work when I\u2019m using Roku for searches, but that\u2019s normal because the keyboard is designed to connect directly to a Smart TV (not to the TV\u2019s connected accessories).<br \/><br \/>The keyboard does feel cheap, and I wouldn't want to use it as a computer keyboard.  However, it's fine for my occasional use as a Smart TV keyboard.<br \/><br \/>NOTE:  The wireless adapter is stored at the upper left of the box, inside the folded cardboard.  The batteries are on the right."}

The cases can be snapped together into a single strip, or tied together with the included Velcro tie.  When tied together, the cases can still be opened individually to get at a single set of stored batteries.<br \/><br \/>These storage cases are just what I needed to organize several sets of different types of rechargeable batteries that cannot be mixed or interchanged when used.  The cases work much better than my old method of wrapping each set in a sheet of paper secured with a rubber band (the batteries always wanted to slide out of the ends of the paper wrappers).  Also, the cases are transparent, so I can see exactly which type of rechargeable battery is stored in each case."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Installation is easy; sound is crisp, headset is adjustable; ear muffs are cushiony but are tight around the head","text":"I ordered this as a replacement for the Plantronics headsets that my company provides. I assume the firm I work for buys a cheaper version of Plantronics because they are always breaking after a couple of weeks or months of daily use. Usually, the problem I have with them is that the left earpiece no longer works.<br \/><br \/>Therefore, I decided to try this one. I've only been using this a week on a Dell Latitude E7470 Ultrabook and I really like them. Installation was easy. All I had to do was plug it into the USB port and the system (Windows 7 Enterprise edition) recognized it. I didn't need to follow the instructions provided. The sound is crisp, the ear muff portion keeps external noise to a minimum, and people hear me well on it. I only received two comments. One morning my boyfriend said he heard a slight echo in the background. At one meeting, the attendees said my voice blanked out for a few seconds. However, I don't believe it is the headset because since I got a new computer I was having this same problem with the Plantronics and that problem was worse. With the Plantronics headset, the voice would blank out entirely and would not come back. I actually had to disconnect the headset, reconnect it, and re-dial my call. With this headset, I did not have to do that. I've since moved the headset to another USB port on the same computer and have not been having any problems. Only time will tell how well this headset holds up. Right now I'm using it all day long over 8 hours a day.<br \/><br \/>I would have rated this five stars except that it is a bit tight. That takes some getting use to. If I had a larger head I would get a headache. The headset is adjustable up and down but that did nothing to loose the grip the ear muffs have around the head.<br \/><br \/>So far I love the performance of this unit. Since it takes a while before problems develop with USB headsets, I will update this review if I have any issues. If I get a full year's use out of these without a problem, then I feel it's worth it. At the listed price of $21.95, I would buy this at its current performance level.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE Feb 25, 2017 - I've been using this headset about 8-10 hours per day and it's performing wonderfully. They are so much better than the Plantronics headsets I was using previously.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE August 8, 2017 - This headset is still going strong at 8-10 hours per day. The headset no longer feels tight on as it did in the beginning. This will be my last post unless the headset breaks.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE October 20, 2017- This headset has finally failed with colleagues telling me my voice is spotty. I can still hear others beautifully but cannot carry on a conversation because they cannot hear me. This is now headed for the garbage. It lasted eight months, which is longer than any other headset I have had."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Charming Case for Small Tablets, No Automatic Wake\/Sleep Feature","text":"The outside of this VERSO KINDLE CASE (SCHOLAR CLASSIC BLACK) is quite charming, because it's a dead ringer for the classic small &#34;composition book&#34; sold at many stationery and office-supply stores.  It fits my Kindle Paperwhite (2nd Gen) and many other similarly-sized tablets well, because it uses elastic corner straps instead of a plastic shell to hold the tablet inside the case.<br \/><br \/>The cover has a mildly unpleasant, rubbery feel, but perhaps it is &#34;unpleasant&#34; only because my eyes tell me to expect a paper or cardboard surface!  The case is NOT thickly padded, but it provides reasonable protection for the tablet and tablet screen, when the tablet is carried inside a bag or tote.  The fact that the case extends beyond the edges of the tablet gives a little bit of protection from short drops.<br \/><br \/>This case doesn't add a lot of bulk to the Kindle Paperwhite, which is good.  The chief drawback is that there is no built-in &#34;automatic sleep\/wake&#34; feature.  With this case, you must press the power button on the tablet to turn it on.  A second drawback is that (in my experience, at least) the elastic corner straps will stretch and loosen their hold on the tablet after the case has been in use for a year or so.<br \/><br \/>I don't particularly care for the lined-paper pattern that is printed inside the cover.  It's kind of distracting when I'm using the Kindle to read a book, unless I fold the cover back.  The case has a useful elastic closure.  Listed for about $30 on Amazon, this case is priced  in keeping with similar tablet covers, but seems a little expensive for what it is.  Overall, I rate it at 3 stars (&#34;It's okay&#34; on the official Amazon scale)."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"I have grown to love this Sling","text":"I have been using this sling for some time now.  When I received this sling I was seriously looking at buying the [[ASIN:B0036AWR8E Lowepro SlingShot 202 AW]] and I think for my purposes, this is the better sling for me.  The one thing I did not like about the Lowpro was that it was broken up into two compartments which limited my ability to put my Canon 200-400 5.6 zoom in it comfortably.  The large main compartment easily, but snugly holds my 40D and lense, which room to spare to include a wide angle.<br \/><br \/>As for slings in general.  I have a Tamarac backpack which I love, but tend to way over pack (because I can.) It is bulky and awkward to wear, but does have a hip belt to take the weight off the shoulders. Also, I tried a holster style case, but it never felt secure and I never trusted my camera and lense in such a flimsy case.  The sling, once in place seems to become a part of my body while hiking and climbing.  It feels more secure than the backpack and far more secure than the holster.<br \/><br \/>Good Points<br \/><br \/> - nice spacious compartment for a DSLR and Zoom lense<br \/> - Sturdy with strap across you chest, it feels very secure on.<br \/> - Rotating the sling gives a sturdy platform to remove or insert camera.<br \/> - It is not big enough to overpack<br \/> - plenty of space for battery, charger, cards, notebook or guide, and two lenses and body<br \/> - Rain cover is nice addition (have not used it, but love the extra insurance.)<br \/> - Well padded<br \/> - Nice construction, classic design.<br \/> - Nice side handle for carrying when not slung.<br \/><br \/>Bad Points<br \/><br \/> - Sling Accentuates Man-boobs (I've tried several different ways of placing the strap, but it seems the only fix is portion control and moderate exercise.)<br \/> - no hip belt so weight is held on shoulders for long hikes, but weight is limited somewhat by size.<br \/><br \/>All in all, I have to admit I have come to love this sling.  It has traveled with me quite a bit and I trust it to hold my treasured camera and lense.  Easy to pack and will handle the essentials.  It is cheaper than the Lowe sling in price, but not functionality.  I recommend this to anyone who wants to pack in a DSLR."}

I like having the option to power the hub via the USB-C port on the side of the unit, which I haven't needed to use yet.<br \/><br \/>The one piece of feedback I would give about these is that the blue light by each port is very small, so if you aren't looking at the hub straight on (e.g., it's flat on the table a few feet away from you), it's hard to tell which ports are on and which aren't.

I wanted to get a second camera which also took great pictures but that was lower priced and better for me to take on extended travel without all my lenses). The Fujifilm FinePix is a good camera. For around the $200 price range, you get a high quality camera with good picture taking quality (14 MP, EVF, 30 times zoom capability). It is easy to learn and use and makes an excellent entry level camera with high quality features (would make a great graduation gift for a high schooler to introduce them to a higher level of picture taking than a simple point and shoot). It is a little large and plasticy, but overall I do recommend it for a good second camera or, as I mentioned, to someone looking to enter the SLR market (but not ready to spend $600+)."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Amazing Device, But With Fierce Learning Curve","text":"This SEAGATE WIRELESS PLUS 1TB MOBILE DEVICE WITH BUILT-IN WI-FI STREAMING is an amazing device, but it has a fierce learning curve.  Usually I'm pretty good at figuring out new hardware and software, but I needed a lot of help from some geeky online friends in order to get this device up and running.<br \/><br \/>Now that I've gotten it to work, I like it a lot.  No matter where I am, the device communicates wirelessly with my mobile devices; it also allows me to connect to an available local network to check email or surf the web (with the usual risks that go along with connecting to a public or unsecured network).  It also allows more than one mobile device to access it at the same time.  It has a full terabyte of storage space, so it will hold a huge amount of music and videos for on-the-road entertainment.<br \/><br \/>However, the device has a lot of warts.  The worst is that it's extremely difficult to transfer purchased video content in formats that will be recognized by different mobile devices.  The various problems I encountered are described in some detail below.<br \/><br \/>***BASIC SETUP.  First, it's not a simple plug-and-play  device.  To set it up, you must (1) charge and turn on the drive (a charger that plugs into an electrical outlet is included); (2) download and install the Seagate Media app from iTunes (for Apple devices), the Amazon App Store (for Kindle Fires), or Google Play (for Android devices);  (3) launch the Seagate Media app (which will enable you to connect to the device's Wi-Fi network signal);  and (4) connect to the Seagate Media Wi-Fi network (which will drop your existing network connection--and give you a \"disconnected\" warning--and then connect immediately to the Seagate network).  Once you're connected to the device's network, you can proceed with the tutorial; if you go through the tutorial before you're connected to the Seagate Media network, you'll be scratching your head, wondering why nothing seems to work.  When you're properly connected, the sample videos run perfectly.<br \/><br \/>***TRANSFERRING CONTENT.  That was the easy part.  Now you face the truly daunting task of transferring your own content to the device.  Some things, like your personal documents and photos, can be copied directly from your computer with no problems.  Although it's possible to connect your computer to the Seagate Media Wi-Fi network and copy files by wireless, it's much easier and faster to connect the device physically via USB cable to your PC or Mac and then copy the files.  The included USB cable has a wide specialized plug that connects to one end of the device--there's a little \"fingernail-slit\" on the back, near the bottom, that allows you to remove the end cover and get at the port.<br \/><br \/>Once you've copied some files, you can disconnect the device from your computer, and access the copied files wirelessly from the device, using the Seagate Media network and app.  The app is sometimes glitchy, and navigation isn't  particularly intuitive, but it works.  The app lets you access files, stream video and music, and connect to any nearby wireless network to check your email or surf the web (without disconnecting from the Seagate Media network).<br \/><br \/>***PLAYING PURCHASED VIDEOS. However, there's a big problem when it comes to playing commercial movies or DVDs.  The ads for this device suggest that you can copy your video files from your PC or Mac, and then use the Seagate Media app to stream them to your mobile devices (e.g., iPad, Kindle Fire).  This may be true of your home movies, but it's certainly not true for purchased videos from Amazon, iTunes, or DVD downloads.  In order to play these purchased videos, you must have the appropriate player available on the device you're using to access the video.  (In fairness, it's the Digital Rights Management add-ons for the videos that is making things difficult, but the Seagate ads are misleading.)<br \/><br \/>It's my understanding that you can use specialized software to convert .mp4 files (probably illegally) to file formats that can be streamed, but .mp4 files won't play if the ones that work with computer media players are simply copied to the Seagate device.  As for movies purchased from Amazon, so far I've been unable to stream mine, because Amazon movies require the \"Unbox\" app.  However, I was able to copy movies purchased from iTunes from my PC and stream them from the device to my iPad.  I did have to download one movie to the iPad first, which apparently installed the necessary player software.<br \/><br \/>***IF YOU BUY THIS DEVICE.  When you're ready to set it up, DO go to the Seagate web site, and download the complete User's Manual (available as a .pdf).  A search for \"Wireless Plus\" should get you to the product's rather extensive support pages.  Most end-users will want the additional information about using the device, even if they're able to get set up with only the brief \"quick start\" sheet that comes in the box, plus the tutorial that introduces the Seagate Media app.<br \/><br \/>DO use the Seagate Media app to set up a password for your device.  If you don't use a password, then anyone who detects your Seagate Media signal and also has the Seagate Media app on his\/her own device will be able to access your device and content.<br \/><br \/>DON'T expect to be able to \"wirelessly stream all your videos, music, photos and documents to your tablet and smartphone\", as the box claims--at least not right away and not without a lot of work.  Some of your videos may not be streamable, and some may not be streamable to all of your mobile devices.  (If it's possible to copy a purchased Amazon video for streaming to anything, I certainly don't know how it's done.)<br \/><br \/>***CONCLUSION.  Because I'm a gadget person who loves fooling around with computer hardware, I like this device a lot--particularly the compact size (3-1\/2\" x 5\") and sleek metallic-gray case.  However, because the SEAGATE WIRELESS PLUS 1TB MOBILE DEVICE WITH BUILT-IN WI-FI STREAMING is so challenging to set up and use, I rate it at only 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale)."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Shock and Awe! Didn\u2019t know Sound could be like this..","text":"Well.. I needed to find a headset that could perform double duty. Not ever purchasing a Bluetooth\/noise canceling headset before I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect! To say the least.. I had to rely on reviews and what I found sounded promising!<br \/><br \/>The sound is better than expected. Being one<br \/>who was born in the 70\u2019s.. I actually was around when this style of headset made its rocking debut for the first time- Let\u2019s just say.. the sound\/fit and quality have reached new heights!! DON\u2019T anyone be fooled by the retro throwback style.. this is a fit that is actually comfortable now and not, head throbbing tight on the temples- or, tweaking ones<br \/>ear due to the cup made to fit.. Um?! Oh yeah, made to fit no one.. !! Instead these have enough stretch to make it feel nice and adjust in height\/angle. I will say- there\u2019s a wee bit of ear sweat bc, the material used doesn\u2019t breathe 100%.. Yet, I'm sure it must be necessary to create a better sound quality!<br \/><br \/>I won\u2019t lie...These aren\u2019t featherweight as if, you could just forget you have them on- but, You can definitely notice the attention to detail that went into making these ergonomically shaped and the care in using light weight material. Where I noticed the weight of the headset most, is when I\u2019d lean my head forward to look at my phone (interesting- we all look down to use our phone- we don\u2019t ever bring our phone up?!) But, doing this I could feel the weight in back of my neck.. Now, I\u2019m sure after using these a few times, you would build up those muscles pretty quick! But, just Something to keep in mind-<br \/>First need was to take on road trip so, I could hear music I liked. Sound itself was not like anything I\u2019d ever heard and I know, it sounds ignorant but- if this isn\u2019t your thing.. how Would you know what to expect?!! Yesss!!! I have used earphones before..<br \/>ie. On a plane or, book on tape at the pool, etc.. Style used is the type that slips into the ear and plugs into a device. I\u2019ve also used AirPod before as well.. But, with this Srhythm or, as I like to call it- \u201cretro\u201d headset.. Best way to describe differences to a lament like myself: Imagine watching a movie at home on a regular TV vs. watching the same movie in a kick-butt dolby theater with surround, upgrades, whistles and bells! Either will suffice. But, knowing the difference- Why would you ever want anything less.. HeLLo!!!<br \/>The Noise canceling option is just a flip of a button and I\u2019m wondering why these aren\u2019t a mandatory gift for parents bringing newborns home from the hospital! They don\u2019t make every sound disappear, rather.. they deafen the noise to let you think and concentrate- this was my other need in getting this headset. I have the hardest time typing emails and papers with verbal conversation happening around me\u2026 Knowing this is a weakness, I wanted to try this novel concept- and Wow! it\u2019s perfect for what I need- I\u2019m sold and a total fan!!! It takes out all the noise clutter yet, let\u2019s you hear needed sounds if necessary. If you have this issue- try this, you won\u2019t be disappointed.<br \/>I\u2019ll admit hooking into Bluetooth was intimidating so, my kiddos did it for me in about 2 seconds. (I don\u2019t care enough about certain things to learn it myself\u2026) The ability to use all options this offers will prob. be too much and not fall in my wheel house- but, for those who want extras.. these have them! Or, you can choose to use in simplest form and be happy with your purchase. After pricing against others brands of the same quality.. these are hands down the best deal.. if you buy, Im sure these won\u2019t disappoint!!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Impressed with the newest model","text":"After two years of research, many many visits to the local Bose store, lots of questions asked, we finally took the plunge with the latest model and enjoyed a 10% sale that was offered at the time! We were looking to replace our current home theatre system with the very large Kiplisch speakers (one of the main reasons for the search and hence was attracted to the jewel boxes) and we were looking for a replacement that was more befitting an apartment space.  Addtional extra was the remote ended up operating more like a harmony, which was not what we had orginally thought (we remain a harmony-run family, with this one exception).  All hooked up to the receiver include the TV, tivo, xbox, apple tv, and play station.<br \/><br \/>We love the slim line look of the receiver and without all the huge speakers in the room, we feel we have gained back a lot of space.  The receiver has inputs\/outputs that really reflects the current modern day demands and entertainment devices.  The speakers are amazing: the centre one offers the best sound in terms of hearing speach in any genre and we are not raising the volume to hear the talking part of a program and then having to turn down the volume when all the sound effects come into play!<br \/><br \/>The set up takes a while, even for my husband who is a technical nerd, but that maybe because of all the additional devices we had to program the remote to learn.  The sound testing system is cool and I am sure that is why we are so enjoying the surround sound effects and the clarity of the voices is beautiful.  The speakers bring music to life - seriously.  we played so many genre and each one just echoed with such depth that you would have thought you were in the recording studio.  We were impressed with the integration of the receiver with the speakers and the sound testing that came with the set-up.<br \/><br \/>One thing to note, we opted to have wireless back speakers which required additional hardware to be purchased.  The sound quality is a tad better with the back speakers wired; but we opted for wireless and we will probably end up not noticing in the long run!<br \/><br \/>The remote was a dream and it did take a little time to learn the language of all our devices.  We thought we couldnt use the infra-red wireless headphones with it - well you can! The cord has be be jacked in the front panel of the receiver and you have to turn up the volume to hear.<br \/><br \/>Like everyone, we were also aware of the high costs, but when you break it down, tangible and tangible benefits do out weigh the 'cost number'.  For those of you who are looking for a cleaner look and good sound quality (loves movies and many genre of music: I am trying to differentiate from those who have ears that pick up a whole lot more than the average population and are very fussy about what they listen to): this being said, it is really worth a look and a serious investigation at this latest Bose Model.<br \/><br \/>This product was not bought on a whim and we had a lot of high demands and requirements, especially where the hamrony-like features and the wireless headphones were concerned!  Seriously, we held back from buying the model earlier as we were still investigating on whether the Harmony could be trained for the Bose system: in the end we were impressed with the Bose remote!<br \/><br \/>We have had the system for over a week now and we cant stop pinching ourselves on the recent purchase and wonder why we had waited so long."}

Fortunately I owned some unusually short screws that worked.<br \/><br \/>In addition the pins on the power cord were bent but correctable without snapping anything. I understand this is not uncommon but combined with the screw problem it left me feeling that this item was built on the cheap.<br \/><br \/>I actually got this item to supplement my case fans, I have a big case, lots of 5\" bays, and I keep it in a fairly closed area of my desk. Only the face is really completely open to the room so I thought it might help keep things cool if it had a little extra 'fresh' air pulled in from there.<br \/><br \/>It's only been mounted a short time but it seems to function fine.  Brand new I can't even hear this unit's fans over the hum of the bigger fans in the back of my case (and they are pretty quiet themselves). It doesn't seem to move a lot of air but they are just little 1 1\/4\" fans.<br \/><br \/>The screw problem was one of those kinda minor things that almost prompted me to send it back, fortunate I had the shorter screws that solved the issue."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Exactly what I was looking for","text":"I was looking for an inexpensive and flexible screen for many uses from throwing on a wall in the kids room to projecting pool side.  This is nearly perfect from price point to storability.  I had a large pull down screen with some black marks on the screen that was a pain to hang and store.  This screen stores down to the size of a encyclopedia and can be pulled out whenever.  The Grommits allow for easy hanging nearly anywhere and I will probably make a quick PVC pipe frame for out door uses.<br \/><br \/>The screen itself is an ultrawhite polyester that projected perfectly in our test movie.  We have a very large cork board in the boys room and this hung perfectly for quick deploying.  I love that the cloth truly does not show wrinkles and can simply be folded and put into the electronics bin. Absolutely perfect for our needs."}

I\u2019m sure it will cost me over<br \/>$100.00 to install those.<br \/><br \/> But Mr. Beams is easy to install.

No more $$$$$$.<br \/><br \/>These lights are allot brighter then we thought.<br \/>Great for when the kids get out of there car to walk to the door, Brighter then the two lights I have on both sides of the garage doors.<br \/>The light stays on for about 30 seconds, but if you are still in the Beam, it will stay on longer, which is a plus for us, when you are<br \/>carry babies, its raining, its snowing (hopefully) or using the code to get into the garage  to come into the house.<br \/><br \/>Also if the power goes off, you will still have light, what a plus for us.Yay.<br \/><br \/>I live on a few acres in the mountains, Ca. Gets VERY dark here at night although we do have some outdoor lights.<br \/>We had a power outage for 9 days here a few years ago, which is along time.<br \/>We used a generator for the frig & freezer, bathrooms etc.(gas cost about 200.00 or more using the generator) but outside it was pitch dark.<br \/> I wish we would have known about Mr. Beams before, it would have made our life allot easier, needless to say.<br \/><br \/>Btw, buy good batteries they last longer, and to replace them in this is very easy.<br \/>We keep a supply of different batteries.<br \/>We will be buying more battery run outdoor lights from Mr. Beams.<br \/><br \/>It said these are also water proof.<br \/> This is a 5 star. If these do not last long,or not water proof, I will be back to up date this review."}

All perks w\/o $ or bulk!!","text":"With a 19yr. old moving out for first time.. he was a little thrown by cost to furnish his digs! (don\u2019t you love life lessons.. when they come back around in such a sweet and satisfying way!) Realizing he was without a most vital aspect.. an ample size TV monitor for gaming and movie streaming- he had to make choice. A TV set up or an actual bed.. Ha! He opted for bed- (although decision was heavily influenced by mama power who offered to split cost of a bed! Cheap move, I know..!!)<br \/><br \/>Leading us to this system as it was a perfect way to have his \u201ccake bed\u201d and eat it too! In leu\u00ed of investing into an expensive and permanent set up during the budget tight times- this can provide option to game and stream movies onto a solid blank wall! Better yet, be a larger screen option than able to afford otherwise!! And truth is- it works so well.. A perfect solution for any during apartment transition yrs. bc it\u2019s so easy to move if\/when needed! All you need is a wall without obstructions (shelf, photos, etc.) smooth surface doesn\u2019t really matter- surprisingly. Plus, this has option to save for screen as a future purchase for respectable $. Or, flat white sheet could even suffice at a bargain $.<br \/><br \/>System is small and compact, we refrained from mounting bracket (we want rental deposit back!) if so, you\u2019ll need a solid flat surface (not the floor!) is needed to stream picture to preferred height on the wall.. we chose flat wood surface step stool that can be put away easily when not in use (stool height was 18\u201d off ground- perfect level for lower profile couch height.) GET THIS- just like regular TV.. this has a remote control. brilliant add!!! Makes the whole system feel more real.. weird, but true.<br \/><br \/>Not being tech savvy- system is compatible with our needs: Playstation, computer, phone, tv stick! I know it has ability for DS card.. tbh, not sure he\u2019ll use function. Included instructions are straightforward for set up- and bc that generation speaks tech.. he was up\/going in under 20 min.. *Best part of booklet is troubleshooting section- questions with answers they provide are beyond helpful, eliminates a lot of easy fixes and tweaks! Hack: take photos of set up info. So, if used on the go.. all needed info is with you! Used x1 already in school parking lot-streamed against side of building. *just be sure to bring along outdoor extension cord to reach power source!!<br \/><br \/>Great alternative for any wanting budget friendly option without the investment in large pieces. So easy to move around in the apartment years.. no worry if TV setup up will fit into a space, etc. no damage or need for help to move.. tiny box can go with you x1 handed! A solid add on for a teen age room or anyplace in between- offers respectable picture and reaches 100\u201d with clear lines and fuzz free image! One can at ore for \u201cbetter\u201d BUT.. if want respectable quality at a great price- this steps up! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone."}

Then there's the whole issues with the cord getting in the way, too. These are perfect for him. They clip over his ears and stay in place well. Since it's a Bluetooth item, it's wireless and has no cords to get in the way. He's been able to get several runs out of them before having to recharge them. They were partially charged upon arrival, so he did need to charge it completely before using. It was easy to pair with his Nexus 5 phone. The sound quality is pretty good, too, though he mainly uses them for his C25K program. He does use traditional larger headphones when listening to stuff when he's not exercising.

Ok, I admit being in my 50's that I am computer illiterate. But my son, in a matter of minutes, had loaded the CD rom and everything set up to go. The first time we used it I was amazed with the quality of the sound and the video. I felt as if the two of us were in the same room, never mind half way around the world from each other. I also found it very easy to use and was surprised to learn that I didn't have to sit immediately in front of the camera to make it work (I actually walked around the room while chatting with him). I also liked the way the Logitech folds up when I am done so it is out of the way until needed. I would highly recommend the Logitech C600 for newbies to this type of technology and realize the valuable uses you can put this camera to.

First, it's nearly impossible to knock over or drop.  Second, it can be set to almost any comfortable viewing angle.  And third, it securely supports your iPad pretty much anywhere you can set it down.<br \/><br \/>To use this stand, you insert your iPad (2 or 3) into the white holder.  The holder grips firmly but gently, and easily releases the iPad whenever you like.  With the iPad in the holder, the beanbag conforms to any surface (a knee, a table, a desktop, a chair arm), and makes a secure base so that the stand cannot suddenly collapse.  The gray beanbag is about the size of a large cantaloupe, and is just heavy enough that it cannot be easily knocked over or knocked off a table.<br \/><br \/>The stand's viewing angle can be adjusted to an almost limitless  number of positions.  The white holder itself can be rotated  so that the iPad is held in a vertical or horizontal position.  Then the actual viewing angle can be adjusted by squishing the gray beanbag to find the most comfortable viewing position.<br \/><br \/>I purchased my BEANPAD FOR iPAD from Woot! for the bargain price of $25 (including shipping).  However, if something happened to mine, I would replace it, because the BEANPAD FOR iPAD allows me to use my iPad comfortably just about anywhere in my entire home."}

End feels pliable so, I expect they\u2019ll crease if used with pressure in the 90\u00b0 \u201cdeath angle!\u201d Exterior isn\u2019t overly robust.. not braided or thicker casing. It will let you wind\/store easy.. but, not offer added protection.<br \/><br \/>Does it work- so far, so good! It lacks the \u201cextra\u201d to combat or reinforce the weak spots. Best for those who are careful or use with minimal daily wear and tear. Prob not best for a teen backpack or traveling career!! Hoping info helps decision.. stay safe everyone."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Works Great!","text":"This is one of those &quot;Seen On TV&quot; products that really delivers! I wasn't expecting much from it, but I have been pleasantly surprised. I'm not sure how it works, but it does a great job of projecting music. The sound quality is pretty good and it can get loud. My teenage daughter loves it! She has an iPhone 6, but the audio port\/jack on her phone is broken. She can't use earphones\/earbuds or AV cables with her phone. With this speaker, she can listen to music on her phone again which makes her quite the happy girl! We tried using it in the car and although it does work, we didn't have a flat, level place for it to sit, so she had to hold it which was a pain. But for at home or outside, this portable speaker is great!!! Batteries aren't included. There's a DC 5V port on it, but it doesn't come with any charger for it."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Compact, Fast, good for foresable future","text":"I replaced a large bulky router\/modem combo from my ISP with this modem, as I already had a good router and didn't need two routers.  My ISP was charging roughly $10 a month for their equipment, which I will save now.  Of course the SB8200 is a little bit pricey, so it will take me about one and half years to recover my cost.  I was surprised how small this modem is; very compact and easy to find space for.  It generates a little heat, but has vent holes all over the outside and top for good ventilation.  Most of heat come out the top, but obviously you don't want to block any of the openings and make sure there is plenty of space above it.  I am getting great speed from the modem and had no issues with it at all.  My ISP was able to set it up remotely in about 30 minutes.  All the &#34;experts&#34; say it is best to have your own equipment, rather than rent from an ISP.  I like that idea, but the only problem is that if equipment fails, you are responsible for it, whereas if you rent from the ISP, they replace any defective equipment at no cost.  Also if you need an equipment upgrade, the ISP covers that too.  I don't expect to need an upgrade as this will handle the fastest speeds being offered now by my ISP (1 Gbps), although not yet in my area.  Right now I have 300 Mbps and the modem handles it nicely without any problem.  This modem does NOT use the Puma chipset, which was causing some issues.  This is a great<br \/>piece of equipment and suitable for home or business.  Just has 4 lights (power on, upload, download and connected to internet).  I thought I had seen comments about the lights being dim, but they are nice and bright; maybe bright enough to almost be distracting at times.  Am very happy so far with the modem and would buy one again if it lasts well over time.  There are a couple other modems by other quality manufacturers that are somewhat comparable to this one, but in side by side comparisons this seems to rate a little better.  The Arris brand was recommended to me and it is the brand used by my ISP."}

The Intel graphics are OK and you can play some good games with decent framerates (I have Epic and Steam installed). There's a sliding camera shutter. The battery lasts about 6-8 hours with normal usage and the whole machine is very quiet and non-intrusive. Has thunderbolt 4 and 2 USB 3.2s.<br \/><br \/>The trackpad is huge but hard to press down on sometimes. The sound should get louder. The keyboard is good but the keys are silver and can be hard to see sometimes even though they light up. The screen is somewhat reflective so I set the Windows background to gray. Overall though it's a great big screen laptop."}

Only potential downside is that the unit runs very hot when left on for prolonged periods...and if you're copying over a significant number of files, that's likely to happen, so I would leave it in the open \/ a well-ventilated space rather than stashed in your camera bag. Otherwise another great tool for serious photographers!"}

You get 3 full bands, One black... one gray.. and one light aqua blue - it's more of a very light gray blue.  They are a rubbery ? silicone like? material. Smooth, no sharp edges.

It was exactly what I was looking for and carries a decent price tag.<br \/><br \/>The one concern is that it is listed as a large gadget bag.  I don't know that I would classify it as large as it is big enough to carry a single dslr with a couple of lenses and a hand full of filters and gadgets. It is actually just the standard base camera kit bag.  So it has enough room to do a day trip, but don't look to deeply into the &#34;Large&#34; in the description.<br \/><br \/>I have actually made this into my birding grab bag and field library.

Thanks anker and I bought the headphone with my own money and anker did not send me anything for free this is all me and I'm not really a review writer where you have 3 pages of review I'm just a sums up guy.<br \/><br \/>On 12.31.19<br \/>After testing it for 2 weeks I found some cons but very minimal and everything good.<br \/><br \/>The good<br \/>The sound quality gets better the more you use it the better it gets so they require certain amount of burn ins.<br \/><br \/>As far as noise cancelling it is doing what it suppose to I mean I paid like $40 for the amount of perks I got on these the high resolution audio codec is enough for me to like these headphones lot.<br \/><br \/>The bad<br \/>It's a small price to pay but it only happens when ANC is turned on so while I have the headphones on my head and I tried to close the door on the car I hear a static noise o don't know if it's a hardware issue or software it's just happens for that second but you definitely hear it and also when your adjusting the headband for headphones than you will hear it too again it doesn't bother me maybe it will bother some people. Also I really haven't tested the headphones while walking or in the wind haven't had that situation yet so once I test them while it's windy and or when j walk I'll write it down. Again for $40 this doesn't bother me I'll use this while sitting down if I have to I'll use my bose for walking and windy situation, but I really like the headphones.<br \/><br \/>Updated!!!!!!!1.13.2020<br \/>I spoke to anker about the popping noise when I adjust the headband it only happens when ANC is active and you also hear the noise when you close the car door and also happens if their is a bump on the road so anyway I emailed anker and they stated that the updated version doesn't make that noise and that we as anker will send new headphones and return the defective one back so that's what I did and if anyone has the same problem just contact anker and they will send a prepaid postage and once they know the headphones is reroute they will send tracking number for a new headphones and yes I received it today and yes the popping noise is their no more yesss!!! Anker goes above and beyond to take care of their customers and now they have a long life customer and will continue to buy anker products and of their is any issues with it just a email will resolve the problem that your having.

While these can be adjusted to fit me, I don't like that in order to do so, the buckle gets moved up right next to the face of the Fitbit. (see picture). Fitbit recommends that the watch band is loose enough that when you shake your wrist, the band moves a little bit. You don't want it to move too much, but it needs to be somewhat loose. I had to adjust it to the max in order to get it to fit loosely. And if you have a larger wrist then I do, it won't work."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Powerful Bluetooth speaker when paired with some devices; not so powerful with iPad Pro; has a few quirks","text":"I purchased four other Bluetooth speakers for my house over a several year period. I have a [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]], which is not very good and a [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] which does not work when paired with some devices and, when it does pair well, it usually lacks the powerful sound I am looking for.<br \/><br \/>I also purchased one [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Audio Block Rocker (iPA76A) | Portable Bluetooth Speaker]] and one [[ASIN:B01N17AQ7U ION Audio IPA88 Tailgater Flash Wireless\/Bluetooth Speaker]] both from Costco. I absolutely love the Block Rocker (except for when paired with my iPad Pro) and I only like the Tailgate Flash. The lights on the Tailgate Flash annoy me because they have to be turned off every time I power on the unit. Nevertheless, the sound from the ION speakers are usually awesome.<br \/><br \/>The IONs are the only ones I use frequently indoors (even though they are more of an outdoor Bluetooth speaker). They are powerful speakers and the sound is intense. However, I wanted something small and more portable and since the Goal Zero does not always function, I figured I would try this Sony.<br \/><br \/>What comes in the Sony box<br \/>- one Bluetooth speaker<br \/>- one micro USB charging cable<br \/>- one quick start guide<br \/>- one user guide - warns against using & leaving unit in a car or sauna but does not say much about how to operate this speaker<br \/>- one limited 1-year warranty insert<br \/>- one pamphlet about the SongPal app - a mobile app from Sony that allows the user to play music or audio from various devices and smartphones.<br \/><br \/>Features on the SONY<br \/><br \/>- It is rated as IPX5 water resistant (not waterproof but close enough; it probably will not soak through in a short burst of heavy rain). See link in comments section of review for description of ratings.<br \/><br \/>- It features a wireless party chain that allows a connection of up to 10 Bluetooth speakers at once. I did not try this feature. I am not sure if all in the party chain have to be Sony speakers or not.<br \/><br \/>- It has a speaker phone voice assist function to allow for hands free voice over IP through the speaker, which I was unable to get working.<br \/><br \/>- It lights up (great for party or listening to vibrant music). I love how the blue light pulsates to the music but it can be turned off if desired and once it is turned off, it remembers that setting until it is turned on again.<br \/><br \/>- It has a speaker add function for adding an extra Sony speaker for surround sound.<br \/><br \/>- It has up to 12 hours of battery life.<br \/><br \/>- It charges from most USB power sources including from the USB port on a laptop<br \/><br \/>These are the control buttons from left to right.<br \/><br \/>- Extra Bass Button (toggles on and off for extra bass); when held for a few seconds it turns off the blue perimeter light. I like that it remembers the last setting so if I turned off the light, the light will remain off until I choose to turn it on again.<br \/><br \/>- Phone Button for speaker phone assist; when held for a few seconds, it says the battery charge percentage. However, I found a quirk in the system. If I am charging the unit and turn it on to get the battery charge percentage, a woman\u2019s voice came on and said 70%. However, if I unplugged the unit from a power source and turned it on, it said it was fully charged.<br \/><br \/>- Pause and Play toggle button<br \/><br \/>- Speaker Add button (Left\/Right) for pairing another Sony speaker to this unit for surround sound.<br \/><br \/>- Minus button for lowering volume.<br \/><br \/>- Plus button for increasing volume.<br \/><br \/>- Power button for tuning the unit on. Once unit is powered on, hold the power button for a few seconds and then release it to pair a device to the Bluetooth speaker. Upon release, a female voice says \u201cpairing\u201d and then it beeps once it is paired.<br \/><br \/>I charged the speaker for a couple of hours before the first use but I am not sure it needed it as the battery indictor fluctuated between 100% and 70% charged depending on whether the unit was plugged in or not. The connector port is located behind the tiny cover on the back of the unit. I had trouble opening this with my fingernails.<br \/><br \/>I paired this speaker with the following devices.<br \/><br \/>- Google Nexus 7 Tablet (2013 version Android device) \u2013 the sound is moderately powerful.<br \/><br \/>- iPad Pro 12.9 \u2013 the sound is okay; I actually prefer the powerful sound that is supplied by the iPad Pro\u2019s own speakers over this Sony speaker. The system wanted me to install SongPal as an option; I found it under another name and after installation, the app said it would probably slow down my iPad so I immediately deleted it.<br \/><br \/>- HP Omen Laptop \u2013 the sound is powerful and much better than the Omen\u2019s own speakers.<br \/><br \/>- Dell Latitude E7470 Laptop \u2013 the sound is powerful and much better than the Dell\u2019s own speakers.<br \/><br \/>As usual, I am disappointed in the user guide. It does not describe each button. It only mentions the Voice Guidance usage and does a poor job at that. However, the quick start guide pictorially shows the buttons as long as one can decipher the pictures.<br \/><br \/>In summary, the unit is sleek, simple, and shaped like a super-sized oblong pill. It is heavy at 1.45 pounds. When powered on, a blue perimeter light outlines the speaker and pulsates to music.  I found this speaker to be moderately powerful when paired with three of the four devices I tried it on. I did not like the sound with the iPad Pro. To get the best performance, I needed to leave on the \u201cExtra Bass.\u201d The battery-charging indicator is a bit quirky and untrustworthy. The charge percentage was different depending on whether I was plugged in or not. I like that it is portable and water resistant. The instructions could be better and until I figured out the unit, I initially had trouble pairing. When using the phone button, I was unable to get voice over IP to route through the speaker no matter what I did. Overall, in comparison to my very portal Goal Zero speaker, this speaker is better. Although it is an unfair comparison, no portable speaker has yet to compare to my two ION speakers. I would have rated this four stars if it were not for the lousy written instructions, the quirky battery charge indicator, and its failure of the speaker phone voice assist. I was also very disappointed in the sound with my iPad Pro. Other than this, this speaker is a good contender for the right application."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Nice camera but way overpriced","text":"Let me start by stating that I received this camera as part of the Vine program. I have used it for almost 2 months now exclusively and this review is based on this. I also own a Canon Rebel (which I used for real photographic ventures like special events, concerts and travel) and a Sony Cyber-shot (which I had be using for more 'quickie' picture taking as it is smaller and I can fit it in my pocket).  Although I found the picture quality far superior with the Fujifilm XF1 than the Sony, the complexity of the Fujifilm along with the high price tag, make it seem like it should be comparable to what I paid for the Rebel. To be honest, the picture quality and the flexibility\/lenses of the Rebel far outweigh the Fujifilm XF1. The way I look at it, the XF1 is a really nice point and shoot. If you are looking for a quality, sleek, stylish camera which is a step above the other pocket sized cameras (especially when it comes to low-light picture capability), and you have several $100 to spend, then the investment may be worth it for you. I just think that if you are a true photographer and want to take quality pictures in the $500 price range, then go for an entry level DSLR which will give you the flexibility of interchanging lenses. I am rating this as a 4 star because, honestly, it's a great camera. It's the price, and what you get for it, that has me shaving one star off the rating."}

The keys are comfortably shaped, and have a nice responsive touch.  With this particular Verbatim keyboard, the keys are totally silent when depressed and released. The mouse buttons are equally silent.<br \/><br \/>The wireless keyboard and mouse operate via transmitting radio signals.  Both need two AAA batteries to operate (4 batteries are included).  Inside the mouse\u2019s battery compartment is a small radio receiver that must be unclipped and plugged into a USB port on your PC or Mac for the devices to work.  Also, the mouse must be turned on.  Once the receiver is plugged in, the computer\u2019s OS will set up the devices automatically.<br \/><br \/>I like this keyboard and mouse combo a lot--especially the smooth-as-silk mouse.

It has performed loyally every day for over a year and fills my appartment with crisp and satisfying sound. While I could find it, the remote worked flawlessly to control but a click wheel and touch ipod.  The only glitch I have ever seen is that occassionaly the sound will stop when there is any kind of hiccup in the wiring - like an air-conditioner kicking in.<br \/><br \/>I have used the accompanying software for my alarm clock for 6 months now and love it except that it keeps the screen of the iPod Touch lit so there is extra light in the room.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Awesome TV. At $2K, it is an excellent value too.","text":"We've had this TV a little more than 2 weeks. When the price dropped to $1997 on Amazon, I snapped it up. For the money, it is the best 4K TV out there. The smart controls work great, allowing you to use apps or browse the Internet on the TV, including side-by-side while you are watching TV. There's only a little 4k stuff out, mostly on Netflix - oceans, desserts, underwater world, etc. They are fantastic! Eventually, there will be more 4k. Haven't tried HDR yet. But, one of the reasons I got the TV was because it was one of ones that had HDR.<br \/><br \/>I used rtings' (http:\/\/www.rtings.com\/tv\/reviews\/samsung\/js8500\/settings) calibration settings to sharpen the picture. Rtings really likes this TV: http:\/\/www.rtings.com\/tv\/reviews\/by-size\/65-inch\/best. It is their second best after the much pricier LG OLED. This review influenced my purchase.<br \/><br \/>One of the main reason I got this TV was to watch movies. It is pretty much theater quality if you can sit within about 8 1\/2 feet of the screen. You start to get the immersion effect when you are a little less the 9 feet away. The picture is still excellent from 10 feet, but you don't quite get the immersion effect. When the shots in the movie are bright, sunny and colorful, the view is spectacular - wow! When the shots are dark you see much more detail than I saw on my previous TV, which was a 2010 47&#34; 1080p LG. It was a good TV that I had professionally calibrated. But, it was no where near the quality of this TV: a 5-6 vs this one that's a 9-10.<br \/><br \/>I thought about the Samsung JS9000, which is $1,000 more - pretty much just for the curved screen. Didn't think it was worth it. The LG OLED 65&#34; is better. Pretty much every review says so. But, it's priced at $4k, which is more than I wanted to spend.<br \/><br \/>For sports, everything is really good. No judder that I've noticed. Daytime watching is plenty bright enough. Amazing picture, especially when the field is in full sunshine. I haven't watched a night football game yet.<br \/><br \/>My wife says: &#34;It's awesome!&#34;."}

The cable (red, white, yellow RCA connectors) seems to perform exactly the same as the equivalent cables that arrived with my cable box, VCR, and DVD player.  The picture and audio quality is perfectly satisfactory (no noise, adequate volume) when used with a small (26\") Sony HD TV.<br \/><br \/>The RCA plugs have wafer-thin curved metal \"prongs\" instead of solid rings, and do not connect to the sockets quite as tightly as do the solid-ring plugs on my other cables.  The plugs look like the plugs on this similar--and possibly the same--product: [[ASIN:B000V0DY70 RiteAV - Audio Video RCA Cable 3ft]]. If your VCR, DVD, TV, and cable box are close together, the three-foot cable length is a big plus, because there is less cable to add to the cable tangle in back.<br \/><br \/>I purchased this cable as a replacement for a defective one left by the cable guy that was delivering too-soft audio.  The cable is perfectly satisfactory for my simple, ordinary setup.  It gets a 3.5 rating, rounded down to a 3 (it's okay), but it could easily be rounded up to a 4 (I like it) because of the low price."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Not able to get it working","text":"What a great idea.  This is what amounts to a portable internet connection that doesn't rely on someone else's wi-fi, that may not be secure.  Great for travelers.  First you have to activate the device, which was very easy and took almost no time.  Then you have to set up a connection to the device from your computer.  Also very easy.  Now for the downside.  I just kept getting an alert that said the device was not connected to the network and gave me a button to connect.  I would press the button and nothing happened.  I couldn't get it to connect to the AT&T network.  I live in a major metro area, so I'm sure there has to be coverage here.  In fact I don't know how the device was able to be activated if it didn't see the network, as activation is through the internet.  I called tech support and they said that it might be because my wireless router was interfering with it.  I switched off my router and still could not connect to the AT&T network.  I also wondered if my wi-fi router interfered with it, wouldn't others also interfere with it?  The tech support person said no, because I wouldn't be that close to them.  Makes no sense to me.  Seems like any signal that could be picked up strongly enough to detect would then interfere.  I don't have the time to mess with this any more, so am giving up for the time being.  Another thing that I did not like is that it appears that the device is always on.  The screen blanks out automatically after a few seconds, which is good.  It also has an on\/off switch, but even though the switch appears to function, it seems like it just turns the display on and off, but the device continues to eat up the battery life.  I don't think the battery will last as long as they claim.  I had the device charged up 100% last night and it still seemed to be charged 100% this morning, but in trying to use it today, it has already dropped to 90% and that's probably from only a few minutes of use.  If I ever get this working, I'll update the review.  At the moment I really don't feel that this is ready for prime time.  My technical knowledge is better than average, so this device could be a real challenge for someone to set up, if they can get it working at all."}

This takes all the time savings out of this design.<br \/><br \/>On the plus side, it is a nice drive and the size and specs are great.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Does nothing special that a real camera can't","text":"A friend of mine bought one of these to take video of his kids.  I tried it.  It works fine for what it is and takes decent video, and I can see why people may not want a full-blown camcorder, but in the market today it makes no sense.  Do yourself a favor and just buy a plain old digital camera instead because almost every cheap digital camera can do what a Flip does except better and sometimes for less money too.<br \/><br \/>Take for example the Canon SD750, which does everything the Flip does and much more for just around $30 extra plus a few bucks for a larger memory card.  It takes good VGA video exactly like a Flip, plays it back on a 3-inch color screen with sound (four times larger than the Flip's 1.5-inch screen) in four different speeds of slow-motion if you want, has a real 3X optical zoom and a 4X digital zoom (Flip is 2X digital zoom only), uses SD memory cards that can easily and cheaply be upgraded and changed (with Flip you're limited to 2GB only and then you have to offload, while a 8GB card costs around $12), and like the Flip it can also play back video directly from the camera through a TV.<br \/><br \/>BUT you can also record video in different resolutions, with effects such as B&W and sepia tones, at different frame rates from 15fps to high-speed 60fps, either in full automatic exposure or with manual tweaks to things like white balance, with stop shutter action where the camera will take one frame every one or two seconds and then play it back as a video, etc.  Or you can just leave it in full auto mode in which case it takes less than three seconds from the time you turn it on to the time you start recording.  It gets along with Windows just fine without any software all (it comes with software but you don't have to use it).  And of course it takes fabulous 7.1 megapixel regular pictures with an enormous number of features.<br \/><br \/>I use the Canon SD750 as an example only because I'm familiar with it.  But almost any digital camera will do what the Flip does and more, and many of them will do it for the same price or even less.  So to me at least it makes no sense to get a Flip unless you're willing to spend more money for simplicity or only want it for the cute factor."}

It was very easy to attach the shield to the iPad2, and there is a magnetic bar to hold your screen cover in place if you are not folding it up as you use your iPad.  In addition to protecting the iPad from scratches, it also keeps fingerprints from the surface.<br \/><br \/>In my opinion, the only negative is price.  When I first opened the box, I was astonished:  Is this it?  I wondered.

Turns out you have to put that on the front of the monacle to attach to the the bracket that also attaches to the phone...and if you have an Otter box cover on your phone, it doesnt fit in the bracket. After taking my phone out of its protective case, we were able to finally get them all together. The picture I took with this set up was zoomed all the way and came out very nice and clear and the color was great and natural. The target was about 50 feet. Then I took the same picture with just my phone and it came out much darker and got blurry as you zoom in closer. So for that I gave it 4 stars.

So as others have noted, there may be a issue of disconnection propensity for this device.  Seems to be solvable by pushing the manual on\/off toggle button on the plug.  But of course if your Wifi internet connection goes down, it won't be able to change its on\/off state.  It is a good sample of the potential pros and cons you might encounter with a broader smarthome configuration.  \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent sound for computer speakers","text":"I installed these on an iMac computer.  The speakers are smaller than I expected from the pictures. They are approximately 7-3\/4\" high by 3-1\/4\" wide by 5-3\/4\" in depth.  Installation was extremely easy and took a few minutes.  The AC power adapter piece slides and locks into the AC power supply.  After that the audio cable gets attached to the right speaker from the computer input to the headphone jack on the back of the computer.  Then the cable rom the left speaker goes into the slot by that name on the right speaker. The AC power adapter then gets plugged into your home outlet and the cable end goes into the jack marked DC power on the right speaker. After this it is just a matter of adjusting the computer volume to 75% on the computer and then turning on the right speaker by adjusting the knob to the volume desired.  One improvement I would recommend is an on\/off light for the speakers.<br \/><br \/>On the back of the right speaker, plug another device into the AUX IN to listen to a different audio device.<br \/><br \/>I played a few tunes from an iTunes playlist both with the computer volume and then again with these speakers.  To my ears the sound through these speakers is crisp, clear, and deep.  I love them!  In my opinion, this is another great product from Bose.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE: Watching videos on the iMac with this system is awesome.  My boyfriend and I love the acoustics and feel as if we're in a theatre."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great cover for price!","text":"After much research I purchased this tablet cover for my husband. I usually purchase more expensive padded phone and tablet covers but they are so expensive. This cover seems protective and he likes the flap that bends that you can use to prop up the tablet. Also he likes the way the flap has a magnet that easily shuts the cover and shuts the screen off when closed and turns on when opened. The case has a spot that holds the stylus which is secure both when the case is open and closed. I got the blue and it looks nice. Great purchase for the price!

Much better touch functionality than my old airpods, Vol up down etc. The are comfortable to wear, this is important as most earbuds out there I've tried are not. This pretty much mimic the outer design of airpods and I think that design is key to the comfort. I've tried much more expensive beats that don't sound as good and hurt my ears to wear.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Decent light solution for traveling","text":"The light is small (4 inches across) but puts out a good amount of light. There are 3 different colors and 10 different brightness levels for each color. It's powered by USB.<br \/><br \/>There were a few things I didn't love about the light: 1- the overhang of the light is larger than the bezels on both of my monitors (see pics) and my 13\" MacBook Pro. 2- The USB cable isn't super long, so it might be tough to have it run from your monitor to the back of your desktop (you probably wouldn't have this issue with a laptop). 3- I would have liked the ability to customize the light colors.<br \/><br \/>My favorite things about the light are: 1- the fact that it can swivel and turn all the way around; when I'm not using it for video calls, I tilt it down, so it serves as a monitor\/desk light. 2- the small size makes it easy to take on-the-go.<br \/><br \/>Overall, if you are looking for a light that is easily portable and does a decent job, this is a good option. If you're going to be using this primarily at your office (i.e., not traveling with it), I would opt for a brighter light that doesn't have such a large overhang."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great looking 'skin' and protector of ipad 2: very light as well","text":"This faux leather sleeve is really light and enhances the overall lightness that comes with the ipad2.  It was very easy to slip the ipad into the sleeve, and there is grips at the side that make it sufficient to hold the ipad in place once it is in the sleeve.  The design is very good in that there are openings in the right places to access all the buttons, switches and speakers on the device (including a hole for the camera at the back)!<br \/><br \/>The feel of the faux leather is very professional and allows for a good grip and no 'sweaty' feel after holding it for more than half an hour.  It looks very professional and complements the new contour of the ipad.  The inside is a light blue felt material that is to avoid scratching the screen.  I think this cover provides more protection to the whole body of the ipad, rather than the new Apple version that only covers the screen.  it is up to you if you are seeking overall protection or adapt to the funky new cover!  At the end of the day both covers the delicate screen.<br \/><br \/>In terms of the additional functionality that allows the ipad to be held at both 45 and 25 degree angle to a flat surface: it holds it well, but is a little 'wobbly' if you are planning to use the screen actively rather than using the attached key board.  I rarely have ipad on a falt surface, it is often held or on my lap so I was not as fused about this option.<br \/><br \/>As an alternative to the ipad2 cover and if you are looking for more protection coverage then this is a really nice option: very nice looking, not bulky and is smartly designed."}

I work in IT and I have seen many better looking stands or monitor arms, but this does everything I need at a decent price.  The one thing I wish it had was channeling to hide the cables a little better, but again, you are getting a decent monitor stand for the price and at this price you can't expect too many niceties like that.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Light Show in Powder Room","text":"This IHOME iAV5B COLOR CHANGING BLUETOOTH RECHARGEABLE STEREO SPEAKER SYSTEM FOR AMAZON ECHO DOT adds a colorful light show to my powder room!  It\u2019s no space hog\u2014the footprint is only slightly wider than the Echo Dot itself (2nd Generation Dot, see buyer warning note below).  The speaker also raises the Dot well above the countertop, so that the Dot\u2019s \u201cactive\u201d light ring is much easier  to see.<br \/><br \/>As for the sound, it\u2019s better than the sound from my original Echo (the tall one with built-in speakers).  It\u2019s a huge improvement over the tinny Dot speakers.  I use the speaker system to play music (from Prime Music, and from my playlist) and environmental sounds (rain, etc.).  I also use it as an intercom (\u201cAlexa, Drop in \u2026.\u201d) and for all the usual Alexa tasks (shopping lists, lookup answers, etc.).<br \/><br \/>The speaker system is very easy to set up.  You place your Gen2 Dot into the well, connect it to the internal USB cable, and plug the speaker into a wall outlet using a USB cable and AC adapter.  (The cable and adapter are NOT included, but you should already have these\u2014you can use the same ones that came with your Dot.)  You then open the Alexa app and use Bluetooth to pair the Dot and the speaker.  (If your Dot is already connected to your wireless network, you don\u2019t have to fool with wireless connections at all.)<br \/><br \/>Once the speaker is plugged in and paired, the buttons on the Dot will turn the power and the mic on and off, and will control the volume.  Voice commands will also control the volume.  A button on the back of the speaker controls the lightshow (color cycling speed, color changing, on\/off).  As long as the speaker is charged, you can move it (and the Dot) around your house, and it will operate without being plugged in.<br \/><br \/>BUYER WARNING NOTE:  This speaker system is designed for the 2nd Generation Echo Dot, which has volume buttons on top. The Gen2 Dot drops into a well atop the speaker, and sits flush with the top edge of the speaker.  My 1st Generation Dot, which has no volume buttons (you adjust the volume by turning the entire top), does NOT work with this speaker.  I was able to force the Gen1 Dot into the well, and to connect it to the speaker\u2019s internal USB cable, but it wouldn\u2019t turn on.  (Fortunately I also owned a Gen2 Dot that I could use.)<br \/><br \/>The speaker system doesn\u2019t seem to be particularly fragile.  I connected my Gen1 (unsuccessfully) and Gen2 Dots to the internal cable repeatedly (at least four times) without breaking anything.  If you need to disconnect the internal cable, it\u2019s easiest to do it gently with pliers, instead of by prying it loose with a screwdriver (per the instructions)."}

Out of the box, it has a solid, perhaps a little heavy feel.  It has a matte crosshatched finish which is not my favorite, but looks classy enough.  The basic shape is elegant, it is thin and sleek and satisfying in the hand.<br \/><br \/>Keyboard\/Touchpad<br \/><br \/>The keys are backlit, crisp to the touch and typing is easy.  It has a slightly compressed full keyboard with a squeezed 10 key which is nice, and at least for my uses fine that the keys are 2\/3rds their normal width. Keypad is sensitive but clicking works better than most and I have no problems with fine control of the cursor.  The fingerprint reader is on the touchpad but does not affect usage and is a nice touch in general.  All in all, inputs through keyboard, touchpad and touchscreen are perfect.<br \/><br \/>Screen<br \/><br \/>Like I said, once this one on, the screen is what stuck out for me.  Wonderfully bright and crisp.  Touch screen controls seem to work fine.  Screen size is great.  We watched a number of HD nature films on it and felt comfortable.  The screen hinges completely around to create a tablet which I far prefer to swivel options.  I also liked the way that it tents for movie and presentation viewing.  Could not be happier with the screen.<br \/><br \/>CPU\/Performance<br \/><br \/>This is a nice quick machine.  SSD, i7 and plenty of RAM out of the box had it booting quick and I see no problems with performance.  I would be amazed and happy to see it approach the 9 hours of battery life that it promises, we'll see about that over time.  My son wanted to put it through the paces with STEAM games but I'm passing - It's mine, but it should handle most reasonable games although it is obviously not optimized for hard core gaming.<br \/><br \/>Summary<br \/><br \/>This is a well built, solid laptop.  It has the makings for a great Netflix platform with it's screen and flexibility of viewing positions of the screen as well as crisp, bright HD.  This is hands down the best laptop I have owned as a complete package.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>+ Super Bright, HD screen<br \/>+ Nice crisp feel to the keyboard<br \/>+ Well powered for standard uses, SSD, i7 and RAM gives it enough muscle<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>-The design of the power cord and jack are disappointing, It looks spindly and its design encourages lateral pressures.

I would not think they would need to zip drivers to put them on a cd, but whatever. Then the installer failed a few times, I had to manually install the driver in device manager that even kind of worked then it stopped working and I had to do it again, but I had already moved my thumb drive so that's annoying I had to get the unzipped file again.

With my iPod on a dock I can use these throughout my entire apartment including lobby with no drops or distortion.<br \/><br \/>I apologize to Sennheiser for mistakenly blaming the headphones.  Here is the original review, unchanged.  Please note that any notes about the bluetooth quality is in error. I have also raised my review to the full five stars it deserves, 9 months later and I love these headphones.<br \/><br \/>----------------------------------------------------<br \/><br \/>I was very happy to receive a reviewer pair of these head phones.  They promise a great audio experience and for the most part they truly deliver.  I have recently moved into a very quiet apartment complex and was looking forward to being able to continue cranking my music while not disturbing my neighbors.<br \/><br \/>I was impressed unboxing the headphones. These headphones are nicely engineered and I listened to them hardwired while charging the batteries, I was very happy with the sound quality.  The fit and comfort were nice, but a little warm and confining when compared to ear buds.  But, I lost a little love when using the bluetooth option.  The bluetooth set up was easy enough, but it was a little muddy when connected to my laptop.  Also the range was about 15 feet, and only line of sight so I could not leave the room without skips and dropouts.<br \/><br \/>The only other word of critique I have for them is that their noise canceling is a little too effective.  I find myself missing phone calls when just 10 feet from the ringing phone.  These are very nice headphones when listening with the included headphone cable, but don't live up to their bluetooth promise for me.  I don't know if I would be very impressed for the price. They are nice, but perhaps not $300 nice."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"This is a lightweight, fully functional laptop (a.k.a. notebook) that I can take anywhere with good screen resolution.","text":"I have been using this for several weeks now and I love how light it is. My iPad with case is 2.14 pounds and this laptop (a.k.a. notebook) weighs 2.35 pounds and has a keyboard that my iPad does not have.<br \/><br \/>Setup was incredibly easy with Cortana (that is Windows 10 personal assistant). The only trouble I had was when I set up the fingerprint security. It took me about 15 minutes of trying and re-trying to use the tip of my index finger. Since the power button is so small (which is where fingerprint security authentication happens), it required lots of rolling my finger at all angles to get the system to learn it.  Once I was set-up, authentication was practically instantaneous. There were several times where it had trouble recognizing my fingerprint. Sometimes it was after I moisturized my hands, which I would expect. However, many times it would not recognize my fingerprint after the notebook woke up. Instead I was asked to enter my pin. The fingerprint results were excellent at first and now sporadic as time goes on.  Note that there are three ways to authenticate - via password, pin, and fingerprint.<br \/><br \/>The screen size is 14 inches with max resolution 1920 x 1080 pixels. I both love and hate this. I love that the screen is small because it makes the laptop easy to carry around; however, I hate that it is small because I cannot see everything I want on the same screen.  I had to reduce the size of my browser to 75% zoom in order to see more without having to do much scrolling. The screen image is beautiful and the front facing camera (a.k.a. webcam), even though awkward when using as a camera, takes a good picture -- see 2nd image. I took this by facing the laptop screen up to my cat.<br \/><br \/>The battery life is very good; however, it is not 17 hours as claimed but varies based on usage. I am able to get about 6 hours of watching movies (Netflix, You Tube, etc.) before it goes down to about 33%. This means a full recharge would be required after about 9 hours of video. In general after using this regularly for several weeks in the evenings for various tasks such as checking email, ordering online, etc., I recharged this about eight times never letting it go lower than 14% before recharging.<br \/><br \/>The system comes with 8 GB and 512 GB of flash memory for storage (not all of which is available but that is typical--see first image) and 1.8 GHz processor. Windows 10 is pre-installed and both the keyboard and touch screen can be used. I personally use a mouse and keyboard to operate my laptop.<br \/><br \/>There's one MicroSD slot and I love that the card does not get lost in the slot. I am able to press in with my fingers to pull it out unlike some other MicroSD slots I have used before. There are also 2 USB Ports (USB 3.0)--one on each side and not two together as shown in the Amazon picture. I use one for a mouse and the other for my removable thumb drive.  There's also one HDMI Port and a USB-C Port, neither of which I use. There's a headphone port as well on the right side--personally I would prefer this on the left side because I feel the cable gets in the way on the right side since I'm right handed.<br \/><br \/>The built in microphone and speaker work well. I used Google Voice to call out and did not need a headset and voice quality on both ends was fantastic. I paired the laptop with my Google Home and my Block Rocker Bluetooth Speaker (separately, of course) and had difficulty in getting the system to pair the first time. This took about 10 minutes of turning Bluetooth on and off and initiating the re-pairing. However, once these speakers were recognized by the system, subsequent pairings went smoothly. Nevertheless, I really did not need to pair any speaker with this notebook as the volume is also excellent even at 76%.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this laptop is great for mobility as I am able to just grab and go due to how light it is. There is a tremendous amount of functionality built into this slim figure and battery life is good. I personally wish there was more than 8 GB of RAM and do struggle a bit with the small screen but overall this is an excellent purchase."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Two-Pack of Stiff, Easy-to-Handle Film Gives Two Chances at Bubble-Free Installation","text":"In my opinion, it's virtually impossible to apply screen protector film to a large tablet--such as an iPad or 8.9\" Kindle Fire--without having a few dust-mote bubbles left when you're finished.  So I like the fact that this MARWARE CLEAR SCREEN PROTECTOR KIT FOR KINDLE FIRE HDX 8.9\" includes two sheets of protective film.  It gives you two chances at achieving a perfect, bubble-free installation.<br \/><br \/>This film is cut to the exact size of the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" screen, and it has a cutout circle for the front-facing camera.  The film is perfectly clear, and doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the touchscreen.<br \/><br \/>The film is stiff enough to be fairly easy to handle during the application.  It has protective sheets on both sides.  First, you clean the HDX screen with the included microfiber cloth.  Second, you remove the protective sheet (#1 tab) from the weak adhesive side of the film.  Third, you apply the film to the HDX screen.  Fourth, you remove the remaining protective sheet (#2 tab).  Finally, you smooth the bubbles out with the included stiff cardboard \"squeegee\".  If you want to try again, the protective film peels off easily without leaving any residue.<br \/><br \/>As usual, I ended up with a few tiny bubbles after my second installation attempt.  However, each of my two attempts resulted in a nearly perfect installation.  For that reason, I'm quite satisfied with this kit."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Invisible, Bubble-Free Installation on First Try","text":"This AMFILM PREMIUM SCREEN PROTECTOR FILM CLEAR is an excellent choice for protecting your Google Nexus 7's touch screen.  It's easy to install, absolutely invisible once installed, and doesn't interfere with the sensitivity of the touch screen.  I was able to achieve a bubble-free installation on the very first try.<br \/><br \/>The installation instructions (printed on the retail packaging envelope) are easy to understand.  The film itself--the middle layer, which is sandwiched between two masking sheets that are removed at the beginning and end of the installation--is stiff enough to lay down easily.  Unlike some protective film, the adhesive doesn't aggressively grab dust motes from the air while you're installing the film.  You get two sheets of film (giving you two chances at a perfect installation), a microfiber cleaning cloth, and a stiff cardboard square for smoothing out bubbles.<br \/><br \/>Because Google Nexus 7 protective film needs only one cutout (for the camera), it's especially easy to install.  Just be careful that you center the film with the hole over the camera, and align it parallel to the tablet's top edge so that it lays down perfectly straight.  When I got a tiny overlap at a top corner, there was a bubble at the edge that wouldn't smooth out.  Rather than remove the otherwise bubble-free film, I raised the corner and trimmed the film with scissors--which fixed the problem."}

There also isn't really a tilt function which would be useful to help get the right distance from the eyepiece.

Instant outdoor air conditioning!! **note: this does not have rechargeable battery..nor, come with external battery boost- if needed you can provide on your own- otherwise, it uses a standard outlet with a wall box\/butt. (not sure what you call them in your house! The same one we use to charge our cell phones!)<br \/><br \/>Light option is handy and provides enough brightness to see surroundings.. personally we use it without. But, option is there if needed.

The surge protector is rated 1080 joules, which is much more protection than you get from most inexpensive surge protectors.  This is plenty of protection for the power surges that happen when the power goes out and is restored suddenly.<br \/><br \/> Because my power company (PGE) delivers a LOT of unexpected power outages, I need surge protectors on all household outlets that service expensive-to-replace electronic equipment (e.g., microwave oven, coffeepot, TV, toaster).<br \/><br \/>This wall mount surge protector works well in my kitchen, where I have several small appliances that I like to leave plugged in.  It also expands a standard 2-outlet wall outlet to 6 outlets.  (This is okay, because I don\u2019t plug kitchen appliances into all 6 outlets at once.)  The surge protector has an orange light that tells you it is working.

It's made of aluminum and feels sturdy in your hand and in the included shock mount.<br \/><br \/>In terms of sound quality, if you are inside, the improved sound quality is apparent over the built-in mic. If you are outside (and using the deadcat cover), it is very apparent. Another thing I really like is that the mic is powered by your phone, and it does not require a dedicated battery, which makes the sounds quality even more impressive.<br \/><br \/>My biggest gripe with this mic is that it does not come with a lightning adapter. Not a huge deal, but this would be the complete package if it did.<br \/><br \/>Overall, if you are looking for a high-quality mic that won't break the bank, this is it."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Difficult to Install, But Provides Good Drop Protection","text":"Because this BLOK PROTECTIVE SHELL FOR IPAD AIR2 is a Logitech product, I trust the manufacturer's claim that it protects an iPad Air2 from 6-foot drops.  I'm certainly not going to test the claim by intentionally dropping my tablet!  I ordered this protective shell after my husband dragged my iPad Air2 off the dining room table onto a chair, and the tablet nearly landed on the ceramic tile floor that breaks everything that falls onto it.<br \/><br \/>Inserting the iPad Air2 into the BLOK shell was very difficult--it took about 20 minutes. You must follow the instructions and start with the tablet's top corners inserted into the shell, because the hard rubber must be worked around the tablet edges inch by inch.  I used a metal spudger tool (on hand for opening mobile device cases) to help, but of course I risked scratching the iPad Air2 case.  (I don't think I did.)  Clearly it will be equally difficult to remove the hard rubber shell, so you don't want to try this product unless you're really in need of drop protection.<br \/><br \/>The shell comes with a screen protector, which I didn't need because my iPad Air2 already had one.  The shell adds weight to the tablet--definitely more weight than my &#34;official&#34; [[ASIN:B00OO9X4O2 Apple iPad Air 2 Smart Case]]--but I'm willing to accept that to get the drop protection.  My tablet lives on a tabletop, but if I should need to travel with it, I will carry it in a protective sleeve (like the [[ASIN:B004Y20KU0 rooCASE Apple iPad Air Sleeve Case Cover]]) that covers the glass.

(Really Apple- is this the best you\u2019ve got... the best solution for a phone that costs more then, my first car\u2026 And you make us use an adapter- no less, called a dongle?!!!) The other fun involved with the dongle, it is trying to find it\u2026for some reason, mine is never where I think I put it. Ha! Well, this set of headphones made these issues obsolete and I swear I would recommend you get this on that feature alone! IPHONE 8+ COMPATIBLE... Woo-Hoo!!<br \/><br \/>As for the sound quality- I\u2019m a mom in my 40\u2019s and believe it or not, my tastes in music are awesome and I do appreciate listening to some kickass music! (I personally believe, I\u2019m a student of the truest form of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u2026 and  I also must say- the best test for sound quality- is always done listening to Queen. RIP Freddie Mercury!) Im not a perfectionist who needs a sound so superior, it\u2019s like sitting in the recording studio with the boys... Let\u2019s be honest, these are a wired pair of headphones, connected to a cell phone! What I want is something reliable that relays good quality sound (equivalent to listening to music in my car.)  If I\u2019m expecting anything else then, I better shell out high $$$ on the top brands.. and we know it\u2019s not uncommon for some to spend $200-$500 on headphones!<br \/>But, if looking for a new pair of headphones, these sound far above average- and surprisingly, they\u2019re quite good at noise canceling those around you. I most often use when headed to the pool or, on the infamous road trip with the kids. Since we all weren\u2019t born with a high tolerance for rap music in this world.. I found these to be salvation! Other headphones I\u2019ve previously used- Apple brand (came with the phone) and skull candy-  neither, would I complain about the output\/sound performance\u2026Ha! That is until I heard the quality difference with this pair. To be fair, the Apple set had issues from the beginning with the dongle-<br \/><br \/>With this headphone, all notes in the music sound crisp and defined...  and even when turned up a bit louder, I didnt notice any of the Vibration noise that some like to pretend is sort of like the base!<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m not sure how or why... or, even what it is that make the sound quality so much better- and truly, for such a lament user of headphones.. I really don\u2019t care why!! I just want a set with good reviews and to order with confidence, expecting to have the same positive experience. I know, I\u2019m not alone when I say; if I spend time\/$ to get an item, I want it to work and work well- Boom! these do.. Both, in construction and sound quality.<br \/>My one complaint would be the lack of comfort with the earpiece after wearing for a long period of time. (watch out if you fall asleep listening to music and these are still in place..I swear I bruised my ear and I didn\u2019t even realize that was a thing?!) the way the clip rides around your ear to keep it in place- seems to bend my ear in a funny way. I will share with you- I did a life hack and fixed the sore spot with a piece of Kleenex- it looked 100% stupid but, it helped with wearing them on the 5 hr. Car ride-<br \/>I suggest just to be sure- you try the clip over the ear to see that it\u2019s a comfortable fit, if you decide to<br \/>purchase\u2026(and for all I know, the problem could be the shape\/size of my ear?!)<br \/>Im definitely happy with the headphones overall and I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll be my new \u201cgo too\u201d pair ."}

To say the least the item became a piece of junk. I was greatly surprised to find this player works SEAMLESSLY with the Region 1 and PAL 2 and no need to punch in any codes. We love it that it has a hdmi output and hence we now have it hooked up with the new LED screen.  It is very small in size and smaller than our recent purchase of a blu ray DVD player!  I was worried there would be issues with this player and I cant be happier!  And now I can keep the DVDs from other regions and now can watch them with complete ease."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good Bargain-Priced HDX 8.9\" Case, But Lacks Automatic Wake-Up Feature","text":"[[VIDEOID:mo2LPRAGS06QPXR]]This MARBLUE ULTRA LIGHTWEIGHT CASE for the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet would be a terrific bargain-priced case, if only the magnets woke the tablet up automatically.  Sadly,  the magnets only hold the cover closed.  Despite that shortcoming, I do like this case.  My HDX rarely travels anywhere, so all I need is a simple case with a built-in stand that will protect the tablet from dust and scratches.<br \/><br \/>This MarBlue Ultra Lightweight case is made of thin leatherette.  It has an interior flap pocket that holds the fairly heavy Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" securely.  The case has a faux-suede lining that makes it feel just a tiny bit luxurious.  The case doesn't have any padding to cushion the HDX from accidental drops, or from loose items in a backpack or bag.<br \/><br \/>The back cover of the case has cutouts for the speakers, power button, volume control, light-level sensor, and rear-facing camera.  As you can see from my accompanying video slide show, these cutouts aren't placed with laser precision.  However, all of the control buttons are accessible, and the off-center cutouts don't faze the rear-facing camera or the light-level sensor.<br \/><br \/>The built-in stand is solid in the \"writing desk\" position, and reasonably solid in the upright position.  The big HDX tablet doesn't wobble in the upright position, but it can be easily knocked over because of the steep upright angle.  The worst feature of the stand is the tab support.  To set up the stand, you need to fold back the front cover, pull the tab on the back cover up with your fingernails,  and then fumble a bit to secure the edge of the folded-back front cover beneath the tab.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, the price (about $20) makes this Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" case an attractive choice if all you need is a bare-bones tablet cover.  Still, because the case doesn't wake my HDX automatically, I rate it at only 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale)."}

Freddie Mercury, Boy George, Go-Go\u2019s.. Wham! Ho-Jo and Frankie goes to Hollywood!!!  These bands transcend me to a younger\/carefree time in life ..A time in life of quality music!!! Well, If you can believe it.. my astute taste in music is not shared amongst my teenage and college kids. So, when traveling as a family unit, I have been deemed the outcast\u2026 and my music is reserved for only finest tastes- translation: I must listen ALONE in my own device!!<br \/><br \/>I am not a music connoisseur or some techno guru therefore, when I plug in a headset- (notice I said plug in.. Bluetooth makes me crazy!! I like control over everything and not being tech savvy means, I would need the help to hook me up... NoT!)<br \/><br \/>when listening to music, I expect some standard of quality. No sound distortion- residual vibration from base- and results to produce crisp sounding vocals. When this happens I consider it a success\u2026PALOVUE LIGHTENING HEADPHONES was the trifecta of all my requirements- I was pleasantly surprised a basic\/minimal plug-in headphone set could bring a decent of quality sound at such a reasonable price. Again- not a connoisseur\u2026 don\u2019t hold me to the verbiage that, i wouldn\u2019t know if I tried to review on a more technical level..!!<br \/><br \/>I realize, I may be the only one that truly believes the greatest invention was the Sony Walkman..??! me\/my cassettes back in the 80\u2019s had a beautiful love affair!! (OMG-saving babysitting $ for batteries was my life..!!) Obviously, this headset surpasses that level in comparison.. Yet, I have the same feeling of being in a happy Bliss!!!<br \/><br \/>I will add, our house boasts 2 pairs of AirPods, a pair of beats, and one Skullcandy high quality lightening platinum headset... I\u2019ve tried them all! I don\u2019t have a complaint about them, other than\u2026 OMG- The dang price! Summer jobs, Santa Claus and the likes have been too good to allow my children these luxuries but, that is just what those are LUXURIES!! For my purpose of listening to music at the pool, taking a brisk walk or, traveling with the fam\u2026 these are perfect! Best of all- I won\u2019t cry or, die.. IF, something happened and these stopped working or, heaven forbid became lost!<br \/><br \/>These are simple, straightforward, easy to use from the moment removed from package!! This set is free of needing help to pair with Bluetooth as, you just plug-in to device.. and go- BooM!! These have standard 3 size ear cushions, to help find a good fit. BUT, the added bonus I appreciated was the clip, its super handy... it allows headphones to be attached to ones shirt- alleviating any excess pull or tension on the slack of the wires. Basically, it helps so, weight of the product will not to pull down on itself- making headphones pop out of ears...<br \/>These would be a great product for someone younger\/older that like things simple.. or, lack text savvy skills and must have simple hook up. I myself struggle with Bluetooth connections and my ego takes a hit asking over and over for help in this department.. so, I relate. (I\u2019m thinking this would be a perfect gift for my grandma- she could connect to her cellphone device -as grandma takes a walk each morning at the ripe old age of 86! This would be a great gift in the future- just plug in connection, and have her Dolly Parton tunes as she heads out on her walk!) This pair of headphones could be compatible for a variety of people.."}

Even though most of us don't have access to 10GB speeds yet, this device is ready for it. You won't need to upgrade when faster speeds are available. It's also thoughtfully designed and constructed. If you need to use it as part of a job that requires mobility, it's fairly portable. Overall, he highly recommended it.<br \/><br \/>Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

I'm not a music expert or picking about the quality. I just like to listen to music. These sound good and worked as they should. I absolutely love the little zipper storage case it comes with. I am also impressed with how much better they fit when you swap out the silicone pieces for a better size. There are 3 different sizes and an extra of each size. The wires don't get tangled either which is a big plus.

Once there, I pressed the 5 button to make it discoverable. Since it remembers the last device I paired, I did not have to make it discoverable again. However, if I wanted to pair a new device, I had to press the 6 key until the unit beeped (about 10 seconds) and then it would clear the Bluetooth memory and become discoverable again.<br \/><br \/>One negative I did see with the external adapter is that the volume is about half that with Bluetooth enabled. What I mean by this is that a volume of 30 on the radio sounds like 15 when paired with Bluetooth.

We've mounted it on a homemade platform that my husband constructed. It has a decent speaker built in, but for movie watching, it's definitely better to have it connected to a home theater sound system. It's also much quieter than the View Sonic in terms of the fan cooling noise. The ViewSonic's noisy fan is the reason we acquired the older projector from my husband's boss.

There are multiple photos in the ads of the TV \"in use\" but not a single one that shows that ugly black box!!!  Here are my thoughts...<br \/>PRO...  (and they are weak)<br \/>- A fairly good picture.<br \/>- Mediocre sound.<br \/>- The art option - which is also on the con - so it kinda wipes this one out. You chose a piece and it will stay on for up to 4 hours.  There is a setting to adjust 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours.<br \/>- The best \"pro\"?  The white frame was easily installed (it has magnets- but the little plastic pieces to secure the outer plastic to the frame are SUPER hard to secure.  Good luck.  I have provided a large number of photos to show all that I am outlining.<br \/>- It's a smart TV - which means you can hook up to your wifi and watch your netflix, prime, hulu, disney+.... but I will say I had to login my \"samsung acct\" in order to \"load\" my Amazon prime.

I should move this to the con list... another pro\/con that wipe each other out.<br \/>CONS....<br \/>- First and foremost - that UGLY black box.  Approximately 9\"x4\"x1 1\/2\" .  You cannot use the tv without it.  The power cord plugs into it.  If you planned on flush mounting (which is included with the TV - the most complicated and awful install imaginable) you will have an ugly black box under the TV.<br \/>- We had to purchase an adjustable frame to mount to the wall in order to hide the black box behind it.  AND a white power cord so that the \"showing\" cord is at least white.  I may hire an electrician to put a plug in behind it but at this point you have to wonder how much more I will spend to make this work as the photos all show.  GRRRR<br \/>- The remote. Good luck getting the back open to put the batteries in!!  It doesn't just \"slide\" open as the only direction on this is printed on the remote - and arrow pointing to the end of the remote.  If you find yourself with one of these TVs - here's a hint... get a dime.  Gently work into the top where the red plastic (the infrared tip) and the white body of the remote... wiggle it - ever so gently - back and forth... We eventually got it open.  Sheesh.<br \/>- We attached the ugly black box to the back of the TV which means we had to install the pull away mount to have room to do that.  So NO flush mount - which I was really looking forward to.<br \/>-  The art.... very pretty.  You get to see ONE - You MUST sign up, with a credit card, for a 31 day free trial to see any others.  It also will not allow you add your own photos unless you sign up.  It costs $4.99 a month after the trial.  There are a lot of art options - but is it worth $4.99.  I am on the fence.  Because it doesn't \"look\" as I was lead to believe it would look like - a flush mounted frame.<br \/><br \/>-  Overall, I am hugely disappointed.  The ads are very, very misleading.  You will find in the official description the mention of a \"mini box\"... which the black box clearly is not - \"mini\" in anyway.<br \/>Also, you should know that if you purchase an adjustable wall mounting kit, you will likely need to alter it to fit.  We had to rig with TWO mounting sets to make it work - The arms were not long enough.  We also tried a larger kit but it showed beyond the edges of the frame even though the mounting kit was meant for a 32\" TV.  Eh.<br \/>For those that are curious - this TV is manufactured in Mexico.<br \/>I would recommend looking for something else - unless you're cool with the ugly black box, a monthly fee for art and a lot of cord dangle.  We did make the choice to keep it - for now.  The thought of trying to repack it was overwhelming.  And in all honesty, we had NO IDEA how much we were going to have to go through to make this work.  If we could have seen into the future, we would have taken the 3 hours to repack and return it.  Live and learn.  I really hope our experience can help others avoid our mistake!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great No-Nonsense Case With Many Comfortable Landscape Viewing Angles","text":"This MARWARE VIBE STANDING CASE for the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet is a great no-nonsense case.  The case is thin enough to be comfortable to hold in your hands, but thick enough to provide some protection from other objects that you might be carrying in a bag, pack, or tote.  The case has the feel of leather (it isn't), and part of the front cover has a nice textured vertical-line pattern that resembles raw silk.<br \/><br \/>The case has an automatic sleep\/wake feature that turns the tablet on or off when you open or close  the cover.  For this feature to work, you must insert the tablet with the on\/off button at the top and the camera on the left, at the center of the case. (When the tablet turns on, you must swipe the \"unlock\" ribbon, or the tablet will turn off again.)  A narrow elastic band holds the cover closed as needed.<br \/><br \/>This case holds the weighty 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet securely in a hard interior frame.  Once you click the tablet into the frame, it won't dislodge easily (although you can pop the tablet out of the frame fairly easily if you need to).  The hard frame snaps onto the back cover. If you need to use the tablet in portrait orientation (say for reading), the front cover folds back easily, and the snap holds the frame and tablet securely.<br \/><br \/>For landscape orientation, you unsnap the snap, fold back the back cover, and move the frame forward to your choice of viewing angles.  A rubbery lining on the inside of the front cover grabs and holds the frame surprisingly well at whatever angle is most comfortable for you.  The tablet won't want to fall flat unless you pick an angle that places the edge of the frame less than 2\" from the edge of the front cover.<br \/><br \/>I really like the shallow viewing angles that are possible when this case is used in landscape orientation.  I actually like this case better than the more expensive [[ASIN:B009X01C64 Marware Revolve Portrait and Landscape Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\"]], which has a padded leather cover and rotating interior frame.  This case is less bulky, and I don't need much padding because my big Kindle Fire HD tablet is mostly a stay-at-home.  If all you want is a sleeve, then you might consider the [[ASIN:B004Y20KU0 rooCASE Super Bubble Neoprene Sleeve Case Cover for Apple iPads]], which fits the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD tablet (without any case) very well."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Blown Away by Sound Quality, Comfort","text":"I\u2019m NOT an audiophile, but I was blown away by the sound quality delivered by these SAMSUNG GEAR ICONX (2018 Edition) BLUETOOTH CORD-FREE FITNESS EARBUDS (w\/On-board 4Gb MP3 Player; Gray (SM-R140NZAAXAR)).  I like classical music, and the sound is so relaxing and immersive, I forget that I\u2019m wearing earbuds.  (It helps that these are totally without wires, of course.)<br \/><br \/>The earbuds are far and away the most comfortable that I\u2019ve ever worn.  You get three sizes of in-ear tips (S, M, L).  There is NO sound leakage to speak of.  The touch controls for music work fine, though it takes some practice to master the double- and triple-taps (sound tracks) and swipes (volume) so that you get consistent results.  For me, it\u2019s easiest to play an album or list at a set volume, without fussing with the controls.<br \/><br \/>I didn\u2019t test the call-answering features or other features beyond playing music.  The earbuds paired, without incident, with my iPad Pro and with my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.  The charging case seems to need to be charged up to the green light for pairing to work.<br \/><br \/>A great feature is that you can copy music files to the earbuds.  They have 4GB of built-in storage.  This means you don\u2019t have to stay within Bluetooth range of your mobile device to play music.<br \/><br \/>Three stars because I haven\u2019t used the earbuds consistently for a full month.  As much as I love these, I\u2019m afraid that the left earbud will fail before long (as other reviewers have reported).<br \/><br \/>Already the left earbud has exhibited signs of NOT charging properly.  With the case closed and plugged in (and with brand-new earbuds), the left charging light blinked red, which indicates \u201cnot charging\u201d.  I corrected the problem by opening the case and reseating the left earbud in the cradle, but of course I\u2019m wondering whether there is a more serious problem that will surface soon."}

The FitBit is comfortable to wear and looks nice. I like that it tracks my heart rate and steps. What I really wanted was to see my notifications on my watch. This watch allows you to see your notifications and will even vibrate to remind you of events on your phone calendar. It is lacking in a couple areas. One\u2014 you can see your notifications but you cannot interact with them at all. It also only shows text, so if someone texts you a gif or emoji it shows up as a blank message. It also doesn\u2019t consistently give me my notifications, but that could be a phone setting issue. Second\u2014 the available apps are limited. You can play music, but only from a couple platforms. You cannot play Amazon music, audible, Scribd, podcaster... Also, the fertility tracking app for FitBit is ridiculously limiting. It is possibly the worst tracking I have ever seen. Since that is in the realm of health, I think it should be a lot better. It is effectively unusable.<br \/>So while this is a cheaper option than others and has heart rate tracking and such, there are still some limitations. It is waterproof\u2014 so I can wear it in the pool. Battery lasts about 3 days on one charge. And you can customize the watch face to your liking."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fastest, Most Reliable Home Network Performance Yet--Delivers Strong Signal Throughout Two-Story Condo","text":"When I first set up a home network, I selected a Cisco \"Linkys\" G router (EA1300) because I recognized the brand name.  Later I upgraded to a Cisco dual-band N router ([[ASIN:B007IL7AKM Linksys EA4500]]), which was--and still is--a superb router.  My latest upgrade, to this LINKSYS AC1900 (EA6900) DUAL BAND SMART WI-FI ROUTER, represents another leap forward in the performance of my home network.<br \/><br \/>The wireless signal is stronger in every corner of my two-story condo.  All of my devices (some 25 computers, tablets, music players, Kindles, cellphones, Roku, etc.) connect very quickly.  Best of all, I'm getting Comcast's promised high-speed Internet speeds of more than 50 Mbps with the Comcast-supplied new telephony modem.  (An online speed test site just now clocked the download speed at 57 Mbps).  In fact, my present home network is capable of even faster speeds--the home network is limited by the speed of the slower external Comcast network.<br \/><br \/>This router is extremely easy to set up.  You just connect it, and follow the prompts from the built-in software.  Whenever you access the router to adjust the settings, and click on some part of the Menu, you find excellent  \"contextual\" help screens that fully explain the meaning of each of the settings.  The Menu is set up differently from the menus for the EA4500 and EA1300, but the basic methodology for the settings is the same--the settings are just presented in a way that's easier for a non-techie user to understand.<br \/><br \/>I read a newspaper review that recommended NOT buying this excellent EA6900 router, because of testers' problems with the second band and with nonfunctioning USB ports.  I think that the testers probably received a defective router--and should have requested a replacement.  Even a reliable brand like Cisco may sometimes ship an occasional bad electronics device.<br \/><br \/>Because I only need a single-band router, I haven't tested the second band on my EA6900 router.  (The second band did work fine on my EA4500 router, but using the second band didn't improve the signal strength, so I didn't continue using it.)  However, I did test the USB ports on the EA6900, and both work really well.  In fact, the router recognized and easily accessed a couple of external wireless storage drives--connected with a 100-foot (!)  USB cable--when my PC was flakey about recognizing those same drives when they were connected directly to the PC with the long cable.<br \/><br \/>I absolutely love this EA6900 router, which I've been using for more than a month now.  Because of my home wiring, the router is located a long way from any of my wireless devices, and I have a lot of nearby neighbors with competing wireless Internet connections.  But with the EA6900, there have been virtually no dropped connections, and the strong signal is something that I've long been wishing for!"}

Fortunately, I don\u2019t have to carry my IPad around like  some people do for their job.  I use mine mostly at a table or desk.  I\u2019m happy that this cover has 3 grooves (instead of the 2 that many covers offer) to hold the IPad at different angles while being worked on, but it would be nice if they were deeper because when working on the IPad when it\u2019s in the vertical position, it sometimes slides out of the groove and slams down."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A lot to like with this power strip; does not have many shortcomings","text":"This has a lot of nice features.  I like the size.  It is not as large as some power strips.  The flat power plug is great, as it can easily fit behind a piece of furniture.  Two of the outlets have extra space for large plugs.  Seems like a lot of the things I need to plug in these days have the larger plugs, so for me that's almost a necessity on a power strip.  Wish they had made 3 or 4 with wider space, but it would have made the power strip larger.  The 3 USB charging ports are a good feature, something you are seeing on more and more power strips these days and it is very convenient for me.  Would have been better with one or two more, as I maxed out the 3 already.  The cord is a little on the short side, but worked okay for me.  An overall nice power strip and I like the white color too.  I replaced a larger, old, cumbersome power station with this and gained back some desk space.  Very satisfied with this."}

This machine was so easy to use. Dad's goal was to be able to view his pictures which he had not seen in 40 plus years. We went in with the expectation that there would be some issues with quality. My Dad was so pleased with how they turned out! Yes, there were some fading issues, but that was expected. There were many slides that didn't have any fading problems. The worst slides regarding the fading were the ones that my Dad had purchased at the Kennedy Space Center & the Indianapolis Motor Speedway! We've scanned over 1000 so far in a matter of a few days. We purchased cans of air to spray on the slides to help remove dust. After one evening session of scanning, we decided to order an extra set of the trays. That sped things up a lot. We still have at least another 1000 to go. When we're finished, I'm going to scan our negatives."}

I had another Type C charging cable to use while I was there, but I always like using the original ones with my phone. I ordered this when I returned home so I wouldn't have that issue next time. The power strip can accommodate many electronic devices. When I first tried it out it worked as expected but after a minute, it stopped. Nothing was getting power. My husband even used a power tester gadget he had and it was registering at zero. I was ready to throw it out at that point. However, I decided to try again the next day. Everything worked this time.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Went dead after 2 1\/2 years.","text":"These are only first impressions of this amp and I will update this review later if necessary. Marantz has actually replaced the 6004 with a newer model, the 6005 which has digital inputs but the 6004 continues to be readily available. It can be had now for about $200 less than its previous price and at $399 it's a real steal.<br \/><br \/>First let me address the assembled in China issue. Yes I would have preferred that it had been assembled in Japan, but its build quality seems excellent to me and I am basing my review upon my hands on impressions of the unit without prejudging it just because it was assembled in China.<br \/><br \/>It's rated at 45 WPC into 8 ohms which doesn't seem like much but it drives my less than efficient vintage ESS HD1500 speakers without missing a beat. Having the volume knob at 11:00 produces ear shattering volume with no noticeable distortion so I am quite pleased with its power. And remember that its power is rated with 0.08% THD which is an honest power rating. Other manufacturers may rate an amp at 100 WPC with 1% THD, but don't be fooled by that. 100 watts with 1% distortion is arguably less power than 45 watts with .08% distortion. I suspect that this amp will provide sufficient clean power for the vast majority of users.<br \/><br \/>Its sound is very mellow and laid back and lacks the harshness that some amps in this price range may be plagued with. I actually had to adjust the brilliance controls on my speakers back to a neutral position. I had them turned down to accommodate my old Onkyo amp. I have it connected to an inexpensive Pioneer CD player, my Directv satellite receiver, a bluray player and my PC via a Fiio E10 DAC and I have to say that it sounds excellent with any of those sources. I'm especially pleased with how it sounds with a good quality Internet radio stream such as some of the Soma FM stations. And with some of my audiophile quality Telarc CD's it totally blows my socks off. It produces good punchy dynamic range for classical music, and disco music with a heavy beat plays well with this amp too. I am using it in the source direct mode since I found no need to adjust its tone controls.<br \/><br \/>I do have one minor quibble but it's not enough to justify docking it one star. The only way to put the amp into standby mode is with its supplied remote control. The power button on the unit itself turns the unit completely on or off but won't put it into standby. And conversely the  remote will only put it in standby and won't turn it completely off. So if you put it into standby with the remote and then try to turn it back on with the power button on the unit that won't work. So be sure you don't lose your remove. And the owner's manual doesn't explain this distinction very well.<br \/><br \/>But overall it's a great amp at a great price and i would heartily recommended it to any one looking for a good amp on a budget.<br \/><br \/>Edit - After 2 1\/2 years of use the unit went dead on me. I tried to turn it on one morning and all I got was a flashing red LED on the front panel and that's it, no sound. I called Marantz support and was told I needed to send it away for repair. Thankfully its three year warranty was in effect.<br \/><br \/>What upsets me is that even though I had done nothing wrong and the unit was under warranty I had to pay to ship it to the repair shop. This is just wrong. Since the unit went bad under warranty shouldn't they have to pay for the shipping? I will never but another Marantz product again.<br \/><br \/>Anyway, they did pay for return shipping and I have it back and it seems to be OK now. But boxing it up and paying to ship it was an ordeal I should not have had to go through."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Well Built Switch; Only HDMI video input; Convenient hook up to computer via standard USB","text":"This is a very expensive KVM switch that is really overkill for an individual, due to the price and the feature of being able to use authentication devices including common access cards (or CAC cards) for access.  CAC cards seem to be a government only system used to securely access computers.  If you are not a government entity, the CAC capability in the switch is a waste, although supposedly there is support for other types of authentication such as fingerprint recognition.  Unfortunately no documentation is provided on how to connect and use authentication devices; there is a USB port for an authentication device for each computer.  No doubt because of the capability of being able to use an authentication device, the switch is more expensive, larger and heavier than a typical KVM switch. Note that CAC or other authentication devices is optional with the switch.  The switch appears to be very solidly built and should last a long time; not flimsy in any way like some cheaper switches can be.  It has big well lighted push buttons for the up to 4 computers that you can attach.  What I didn't like is that there apparently is no software switching between computers; you have to use the manual push buttons.  (On the switch I was using I just press scroll lock twice and the computer number of 1,2,3 or 4.)  What I truly do like about this switch is the fact that keyboard and mouse are controlled from a single USB cable that plugs into the switch and into your computer.  I could not fathom this at first, as the KVM switches that I am used to have a 3-way cable that plugs into the mouse port, keyboard port and monitor and then into the switch with a 15-pin connector.  I didn't realize that a single USB cable could handle both keyboard and mouse, but this switch is designed to do that.  You just plug one end of a regular USB cable into the switch and the other into a USB port on the computer (has to be a built-in one, by the way; not on a USB hub or extender).  You don't even need the keyboard and mouse ports on your computer.  One thing I wasn't thrilled about is that the only monitor input to the switch is HDMI.  The cables you may need to connect each computer's video output and your master console monitor will vary depending on what kinds of outputs you have available.  For a KVM this expensive, it would seem that they could have included the older standard video connection (the 15-pin) that was the usual way to connect for many years until newer connectors such as HDMI and DVI came along.  In any case, the switch comes with no cables, so you have to buy your own.  I ended up needing 3 different kinds due to age of the various computers and the monitor and the types of video output(s) they had.  I called support over my confusion on the cables and they call you back the next day; no immediate support I guess, unless you are on a paid plan.  Didn't feel I got a good answer from support and was still confused about the cables until I actually connected it and started using it. To be fair, this may not have really been the fault of support, but my fault for not understanding how to ask my questions correctly.  The biggest problem with this switch is that the documentation is woefully lacking.  There should be some explanation about how this differs from a regular KVM switch and what kinds of cables you might need.  This is a fine product, but is hurt by so little documentation and lack of explanations of how to connect it.  Also, note this is a powered switch, so you do need a outlet to run it.  If you want a top of the line KVM switch, this is it, but it's far from perfect.  Not for novices."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Absolutely Beautiful Fan, but...","text":"I love the elegant design of this fan.  The only thing that holds this back from being a perfect fan is the unfortunate use of plastic for the wood grain parts.  That takes away the richness of the fan. It would have been so much better, so much classier had they used real wood.  In fact, I think I'll be fashioning wood replacement parts to make it what it could have been.<br \/><br \/>The fan is very quiet. On low, it is nearly silent, on high it is not very loud at all.  Easily the quietest fan I have ever owned. The touch controls on the fan are good and work with a simple brush. The blades are soft when you brush them accidentally.<br \/><br \/>I so wish they had gone with real wood, this is a beautiful and functional fan."}

Ordered in navy- I love these were Nautica\u2019s signature color- very sleek and sharp looking. A switch to the latest iPhone had us in need of a wireless option.. and these stepped up to the task.<br \/><br \/>Impressive sound quality- we needed no nonsense and dependable option to conduct corporate business from home. What better endorsement then to report-headphones surpassed expectations in functionality and no tech failures.. along with a crispness and clarity in verbiage. Nothing muffled or distorted by poor sound.. word recognition was precise- which is a huge plus with business dealings in finite numbers\/details! There\u2019s no room for error which is a lot of pressure for any headset and yet, these stepped up!!<br \/><br \/>Love the ease one can switch from music to phone- buttons are easily accessible and no nonsense to use.. the kind you memorize after x1-2 uses. Loving the ability to hang around the neck.. Trust me you wont misplace as they\u2019re holding till needed! A perfect feature for exercising.. Magnetic heads come together to secure a complete circle around the neck. Simple overnite charge provides plenty of battery life for the entire next day.. such a nice piece!!<br \/><br \/>Not just ideal for chit-chatting purposes.. these deliver surprisingly deep bass! Crystal clear sound allows for exceptional acoustics- you can actually hear the precise notes being played.. I\u2019m impressed and for $40- I have nothing but praises for price, quality and aesthetics.. a total trifecta! Hoping this info helps your decision- stay safe everyone."}

It does fit and does work and charge okay but for some reason it is a loose fit when you connect it to the scrub itself?

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Echo Dot 2nd gen","text":"So... I own both the tower and now several dots.  Of course the dots are more reasonably priced, however, the speaker ability is really where it's vastly different.  Obviously the tower is much better in the speaker department.  However, I did find that there is a cordless speaker you can buy to go with your 2nd gen dot that is an improvement and still at lower price point than the tower when combined with the cost of the dot. (Mokcao cordless speaker - amazon sells it too) Because the dots are so reasonably priced we have them in all 3 major rooms and use the cordless speaker to drop one dot in and take it outside to our sunroom when we like.  Over all, I am pleased with both my tower AND dots... but probably will stick to dot purchases in the future because of the price point.  I would say if you've been on the fence, the dot is well worth a try.  It's very easy to set up, you will need to download the app, also easy to follow step by step setups.  Once you're hooked up you will be amazed at how often you use Alexa.  At our house she helps me keep track of where I am supposed to be every day... timers... night time meditation... the occasional argument and even plays games with us as well as much needed comedic relief.  It may not be &#34;necessary&#34; to have Alexa, but I am always surprised at how often we use her assistance.  It's nice and worth it to us.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."}

The 17-inch version is fat and heavy, a lot more than the Dell 7706. The speakers are better than the Dell though. The touchscreen works fine but it's very reflective and 1920x1080 FHD resolution isn't great for a 17-inch display.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A Very Nice, Basic Handheld GPS","text":"I bought a [[ASIN:B00542NV32 Garmin eTrex 10 Worldwide Handheld GPS Navigator]] a while ago and and was fairly happy with it except that I have two boys and there was some squabbling over who got to hold the GPS.  I figured that a second GPS would solve the problem (which it did, except I still don't have one.)<br \/><br \/>This is a still a pretty basic GPS unit, but very usable for us small time geocachers.  The embedded maps on this device are far better than the Garmin and I like the overall design better.  Otherwise the functionality is pretty much the same, right down to the less than intuitive menus and lack of an easy way to simply input a coordinate.  If you are trying to set a waypoint or mark a location, it is very straight forward. Likewise, downloading geocache coordinates is great. However, I have yet to find a great way to input a coordinate.  Why isn't there an option of a  \"Go to this coordinate\" button that then prompts you to enter the coordinate?  That seems completely intuitive to me, yet I cannot find this functionality on either this or the etrex. (please comment if you know how to do this, I have just been altering existing waypoints or caches.)<br \/><br \/>I don't think I could be happier with the form factor.  It fits well in the hand and is, for lack of a better word, cute.  I have had fun using this with the boys and I appreciate another excuse to get them outside and almost unwired for a while.  I have also used it to mark fishing spots on lakes and keep general information for walks.  It's a very nice little unit."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Compact Device Charges Original Fire, Kindle Keyboard in Less Time","text":"When I preordered an 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD, I also ordered one of these KINDLE POWERFAST ACCELERATED chargers.  It shipped immediately, and does exactly what I was hoping for.  It charges my heavily used original Kindle Fire in substantially less time.  It also charges my Kindle Keyboard in less time.  Amazon promises a time savings of about 25%, which seems about right, although it may actually do a little better.<br \/><br \/>The standard Kindle USB connector cord plugs into the charger, and the charger plugs into any standard electrical outlet.  Amazon says that the charger is designed for use with Kindle Fires and Kindle e-readers, so I didn't test the charger with anything else.  I also labeled the charger so that I won't forget that it's intended for Kindles.  This little square, black, boxy charger is easy to store and carry along with a Kindle Fire.  I much prefer it to the earlier Kindle Fire charger that consists of a power cord with permanently attached \"wall wart\".<br \/><br \/>EDIT 10\/1\/12:  The Amazon product description now states that the charger will not charge an e-reader like my Kindle Keyboard any faster.  That was not my impression, but the device definitely charges my original Fire in less time.  I still like the fact that I can use the fast charger with both Kindle devices."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"As good as the more expensive Leica brand binoculars","text":"This is my third pair of binoculars.  Years ago I purchased a pair of Yamaha bincolars for about $200 of a similar power (8 or 10) and diameter (42 or 50) for wildlife viewing.  The lens stopped working after two years so I then purchased a fantastic pair of waterproof 10 x 42 Leica binoculars that have served me well on vacation and when I went on safari.<br \/><br \/>However, these Endeavor ED 8420 binoculars by Vanguard (at the current list price of $339.88) seem to be almost as good as my $1,000 Leica's with the exception that these are not waterproof and the power is only 8 instead of 10.  According to the package, it also comes with a lifetime warranty.<br \/><br \/>The only trouble I had was putting on the carrying strap.  The diopter ring was easily set and locks securely once set.  The eye cups are easily adjustable.  However, because I wear glasses, I had to leave them in the down position.  The objective lens cap is fixed onto the binoculars with rubber rings and the eye cap (cover) is hooked onto the carrying strap. This means there are no pieces to lose, which is nice. The body cover has a nice grip to it so the bincoulars are unlikely to fall out of my hands. The weight is 25.8 ounces.<br \/><br \/>According to the instructions, there is also a tripod adapter which sits between the lens.  I honestly don't know if this would work on all tripods after you screw off the cap because of its position and I did not try this feature.  A carrying case and lens cloth also is provided.<br \/><br \/>Although I am not a bincoluar connoisseur by any means, this pair I received for review have impressed me.  Time will tell if they last like the Leica's or fail like the Yamaha I had. However, if they fail there's always that lifetime warranty where all that has to be paid is shipping both ways.  That's not too bad a deal."}

I tried it again with the TV turned off and then it worked fine at power up and paired perfectly.  I had great hopes for this device and it seems to work fine if you have a QWERTY keyboard displayed on the screen or an actual input area for you to type in.  In some places it simply doesn't work, such as YouTube.  The search screen for YouTube does not display a keyboard, but the letters in alpha order and you have to move around and select letters instead of just being able to type in your selection.  My wife uses the TV a lot and watches almost everything from YouTube, so this isn't going to provide much of a benefit over the remote that came with the TV.  There is nothing really wrong with the keyboard; it is just that various services provided on the TV just haven't standardized on one way to do alphanumeric input and on searches.  Some of the services just aren't responsive to typing from the keyboard, which is too bad.  The keyboard is a great idea and may work for you; just be aware of the limitations and that you probably can't type in your search strings in all places on your Smart TV."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Research Helps You Choose Range Extender or Mesh Network","text":"If you have dead zones or areas with weak network signals in your home, you can fix these with range extenders (fairly inexpensive network add-ons) or mesh networks (fairly expensive router replacements). Range extenders (e.g., simple [[ASIN:B00PEW7V7E TP-Link Range Extender]]) communicate with your router over your wireless network and repeat the signal to increase the router\u2019s reach.  Mesh networks use router-like devices that you place around your home (one on each floor, perhaps); the mesh devices then communicate with each other using mesh technology (not wireless) and deliver the network signal to nearby areas of your home.  Mesh extenders (e.g., [[ASIN:B07DQ96B95 NETGEAR Nighthawk X6 AC2200 Tri-Band WiFi Mesh Extender]]) are also available that work with, rather than replace, your router.<br \/><br \/>You probably want to do some research before choosing a network-signal-enhancing device or system.  The range extenders (including the kind that use mesh technology) can be tricky to set up (requiring an initial connection to the device\u2019s separate network) and\/or to locate optimally (though some extenders have signal strength indicators that help).  Standard range extenders also consume some home network bandwidth.  The mesh networks may be easy to set up initially (especially if you buy all the nodes you need at the same time), but they may be quirky or buggy, as all newer technology systems seem to be.<br \/><br \/>This NETGEAR ORBI WHOLE HOME MESH WIFI SYSTEM WITH TRIBAND (Wireless router replacement, no WiFi dead zones, Works with Amazon Alexa, Up to 4000 sqft, 2pk (RBK40)) has been well received by media reviewers (e.g., CNet, Tom\u2019s Guide, Digital Trends, Techspot).  Another version, the ORBI RBK50, gets high marks from PC Magazine (July 2018).<br \/><br \/>When I decided to try a mesh network, I went with the Netgear Orbi RBK40, because Netgear routers have always worked best for me.  (The Netgear routers are stable, don\u2019t drop signals, are able to handle many connected devices, have easy-to-use software, and are long-lasting).  I\u2019m too new to the Orbi RBK40 to weigh in on the long-term performance, but so far it does what I wanted--it reliably extends my network into my garage without consuming a lot of bandwidth."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"FIVE WELL DESERVED STARS...","text":"As a long time Kindle Fire user I was happy to see the new HD8. I waited until the price was unbelievable before purchasing because I didn't want to be disappointed. I loved the old Kindle Fire, the body, the features, all of it. I was extremely disappointed when Amazon did away with the indestructible design of the old Fire. My HD6 has been thrown, tossed, dropped more times than I can count (in a subway station, on concrete, on asphalt) and it just shuts itself off until you're ready to respect it. Turn it on and pick up right where you left off. I've had it for two years and I never planned on giving it up..until now.<br \/>I wanted the HD8 because I am a reader and being limited to how many books I can have at my fingertips is hurtful. I have over 3K books in the cloud and selfishly I wanted to keep about 1,000 on hand. New book, favorites, classics. Not having expandable memory affected that. With the HD8, I now have the capability to have my requisite 1000 books on hand at all times.<br \/>As a lover of all Amazon,  I have a Fire TV. Last weekend my very sweet teenage children lost the remote and I was too in awe of their skill to search for it. I downloaded the app on my HD8 and it connected in under a minute. I know this app was always around, I've seen it but...on the tablet it's amazing. I have a blank screen and I just swipe using my finger to my hearts content.<br \/>Now to the technical stuff that I don't always get...the screen is crisp, very bright. The size is perfect and that was my initial concern. I didn't want a huge tablet but when I use the case I prop it on my tummy when I'm laying on the couch reading and it's perfect. Text to Speech is the best thing ever as of this minute. My books read to me...no need to pull up Audible as well!<br \/>I haven't seen any other major changes and I've been using a Fire HD for years, but I am in love with this one.<br \/>This will sound strange but my advice is get a case for it. Amazon sellers have a wide variety of cases and with the delicate feel of this tablet I am still a little wary of dropping it. Also, being able to prop it up makes it great for using it in the kitchen for your cookbooks, reading while laying down or watching movies in the bathroom (bubble bath-highly recommended).<br \/>As with my other Fire I take this one now with me EVERYWHERE I go. When I leave the house I grab cellphone, car keys and Kindle everytime. I highly recommend."}

I would have hoped that motorola would have been able to nail down the design and build of these earbuds to work well. Maybe this is the first batch that came out and its just being buggy with the firmware but there are some things that are frustrating with this headset especially when they have some out for less then $100.<br \/><br \/>As others have stated, when you have the earbuds in, they both are required to be in or the music stops playing. At first this seems like a good idea but when you want to listen to whats going on around you, you'll also be pausing music.<br \/><br \/>They feel a little awkward in the ear, doesn't feel very secure if running around, but in the gym they seemed to work well enough unless jumping around.<br \/><br \/>I understand why the earbuds need to be connected to the dock to change settings but they are bluetooth. It should be a simple enough solution to change all the settings in the app or device being used without having to put them in the dock every time.<br \/><br \/>Battery life has not been great with the advertised 12 hours. Usually getting a few hours out of them and thats with using them when i first got them letting them die all the way and then charging them up.<br \/><br \/>I along with a handful of others appear to be having issues with the right earbud dropping out randomly... kinda odd, might be a firmware thing but unknown.<br \/><br \/>For the money, I would wait till Motorola is able to make a second pass over this product.

I am just going to tell you the truth. I am 70 years old and I purchased these cameras because I live alone and I wanted security. I am not secure and I do not feel secure. I purchased due to all the advertisements and because Shaq endorsed them. They do not work and the customer service really sucks. One day I was put on hold for 45 minutes then hung up on. The supervisors are no help at all. I purchased 3 floodlight cameras and 1 doorbell camera. They all are malfunctioning. The doorbell does not alert until the person is long gone. What is the purpose if the incident is over before you can even see it. Then you cannot even pull the incident up for about 4-5 minutes! You have to wait to see who was at your door and that's not safe. in 4-5 minutes someone could already be in your house!! I have horrible neighbors who are interfering with one of the floodlight cameras and literally making it go off every 1-3 minutes. I've called ring over 52 times since October of 2019. They cannot or will not resolve the issue, other than tell me the camera cannot be tampered with. I KNOW THAT IS NOT CORRECT! If you buy these cameras buy at your own risk. I am here to tell you that they do not work and customer service will not help you when they fail and they will fail!!!! Shame on you Shaq O' Neal. Shame on you Amazon for buying and selling this mess !!!!!!!  On my last recent call to Ring I was told that the cameras do not work in real time. The representatives say whatever they want to try and get you to hang up. I'm 70 not senile. Someone named Richmond told me that! The commercials show the people walking up, you activating the sound and talking to the person. One of My problems is the people are already gone before the camera actually activates. I would look into buying something else if I could afford it. You have a choice. DO NOT BUY RING. Do not be tricked like I was."}

It wouldn\u2019t go all the way in, and made the battery eject button lock, so it was stuck. I had to pry it out. It\u2019s a miracle it didn\u2019t ruin the battery port.<br \/><br \/>Terrible quality control, and now I have to wait on a second replacement.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Nice speaker but better options out there","text":"This is a nice little boombox that\u2019s great for low to mid level sound with decent bass. Also has a cool light and can be paired with other doss speakers for fuller\/louder sound. My review is based on the one DOSS party boom speaker. It\u2019s light weight which may save your arm but probably contributes to distortion if you try to crank the volume. My biggest grip is there is no battery level indicator. I have a ION block rocker that $20 more than this is currently selling for. It cam with a microphone and the sound is better cranked up. It also tells you how much battery is left. The only thing the DOSS has over the ION is the lights, weight it\u2019s $20 cheaper. Do your research find out which one works best for you. If $20 is a too much and you need something lighter with cool lighting than this box may be for you."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Attractive Wrist Band","text":"This wrist band is a big improvement on the silicone bands that I have for my Fitbit Alta (not HR). It fits my Fitbit very well. The band is really large. I have a large wrist and usually link bands don't fit at all.  I was able to take 2 links out and it was still a little loose, but with removing the 3rd link, it was too tight. Removing the links was just like the directions showed, but I found it a bit difficult to open up each link that I was removing. What I didn't care for about the wrist band was that it wasn't a simple process to put it on or take it off. It wasn't hard, but it was a pain. You have to slide it on\/off to the actual Fitbit rather than using a clasp on the band. It's nice looking, but takes more time than my previous band to put on."}

There are plenty of holes for easy adjustment.  It is black leather and sparkly - the sparkly doesn't rub off.  I've taken to wearing it most of the time.  The ends snap on very securely.  I actually purchased two of these... one for me, one for my mom.  She likes it too.  It will probably last longer than my fitbit 3.  Having said that.. I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful and I hope my review and pic was helpful to you!<br \/>UPDATE: 9\/7\/2019.... After wearing this band for several months... I have to say that the extra long length of the band is kind of annoying... it's just too long.  I have an average wrist - so it's not like a have a super small wrist.  You could cut the extra length - but that would effect the look for sure.  I love the sparkly black leather band - I find that the extra length catches on stuff.  There is a second band loop, but it doesn't stay put.  Just sayin."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A No Frills, High Quality Organizer for My Action Cam","text":"This is not the most gorgeous, whistles and bells laden case out there, but what it lacks in aesthetic glitz it makes up for in utilty and ruggedness.  For me, I was looking for a way to organize a Sony HDR-AS100VR POV Action Video Camera with a couple of mounts and their tiny remote monitor.  So I did not need a lot of space, just a protective, organizing case.  This is not the biggest case in the world so if you are running multiple GoPros with a ton of mounts, it's not for you.  It will work fine for my single cam needs.  Personally I love that I can pack this in my luggage.<br \/><br \/>As for organization... There is a nice side pocket for cables, three bays for storing the components, including one Velcro adjustable bay so your can customize two of the bays a little. Internally, there is another side pocket, two multiuse but smallish mesh pockets and three elastic bays to store SD cards.  So you have enough room for everything you would need for a personal Action Cam and perfect for what I was looking for.<br \/><br \/>The case is lightly padded, but offers ok protection for traveling in a backpack etc.  Not waterproof but probably somewhat water resistant for rain and light splashing  The zippers are reinforced at the ends to avoid fraying as are handles and zipper pulls.  It really seems to be designed with long lifespan in mind.  The looks are understated but classy.  All in all, perfect for what I was looking for.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>+ Rugged Design<br \/>+ Small for a single camera set up<br \/>+ Will pack well into luggage<br \/>+ Good organizational pockets inside and out<br \/>+ Well manufactured and reinforced<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>- Not very big so might be to small if you have multiple mounts<br \/>- Not the most beautiful bag on the market, but very functional"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Graphics!","text":"We weren't particularly looking for a gaming computer, but our 17 year old daughter was in the market for a new laptop. She had been using her brother's old laptop, but it wasn't powerful enough to run one of the games she wanted to play. It was basically an older, outdated laptop without the capability to run modern gaming software. She's going to college next year and needed something that would let her do school assignments on and allow her to stream movies too. She's pretty busy, but she does enjoy a good 3rd person shooter game now and then. This laptop has met all of her needs so far. She can do all three. It was easy to set up out of the box. Cortana talked her through it. She hasn't been able to figure out how to change the colors of the keyboard yet. We looked up videos online and they told us to go to the settings and select an option that isn't there. So for the time being, she's stuck with red lights. Battery time has been fine. She is usually near an outlet so there haven't been any issues yet with battery life. It's fairly light weight and fits in her backpack easily. Overall, she is quite happy with it."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"IMPRESSIVE - VERY NICE","text":"Never thought I would want an all-in-one computer because you can't expand it at all, but with USB you don't really need to, as you can add external USB drives or devices (printers, scanners, etc.) easily or even use USB flash drives.  Of course you can't add memory, but this comes with 8 gig, which is really all you need these days, unless you are a gamer.  This has a nice large display screen with a clear picture.  Will be great for watching video.  Has a built in microphone and video camera.  Tried the microphone with Windows 10 assistant Cortana and it works great (even though it warned me that it might not).  Comes with Windows 10 pre-installed.  All you have to do is customize a few local settings (time zone, language, etc.) and you are ready to go.  Because everything is built in to the screen, setup time is very fast.  You plug it in and turn it on.  You do have to put batteries in the wireless mouse and keyboard, but they are included, as was the USB stick needed for the wireless devices.  Was up and running in no time.  The wireless mouse and keyboard is nice, but the keyboard is a flat keyboard and I much prefer an ergo keyboard, so I probably won't use the keyboard.  My biggest problem in the past with wireless devices is that they go through batteries fast.  This keyboard and mouse have on\/off switches, so you aren't using up the battery when you aren't using the computer.  With everything built into one unit, you might think it would be pretty heavy.  It is heavy, but most people could move it without difficulty.  There is a lot to like about this system and not much to dislike.  I was disappointed that it didn't have more USB ports.  There were only 2 on the back and 2 on the side.  One of the 4 is used for a tiny USB stick that is used for wireless communication with the keyboard and mouse.  You'll quickly run out of USB ports, so you may need a USB hub, if you have more than a couple of devices to hook up.  The 500 gig hard drive is a little small by today's standards, but should be big enough for most people.  For lots of data storage an external source is really more ideal than saving on the C: drive.  You might be able to get a little more computer for less money, but it seems to me that the pricing is not that bad, considering what you get.  Also includes McAfee internet security and some cloud storage (although small and you have to do things to increase it or pay for more space).  Overall not a bad value and ideal for limited space.  No cords and wires to deal with.  You have only the power cord to deal with.  I was also impressed that it included an optical drive.  Many newer systems (especially laptops) don't include a DVD drives anymore.  Performance seemed a little slow, but nothing significant.  I think most people will be happy with this system and it will meet the needs of all but the most demanding users."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Not Workable","text":"I really wanted to like this Chromebolk. Unfortunately, it is just frustrating. I figured since I just needed to access classes on the internet and submit writing assignments, this would be perfect. I was wrong. It is a glorified tablet. I don\u2019t care what they say, chrome books are not the same as a computer. The work arounds to get the operating system to work properly are just too frustrating. Everything is app based, meaning you\u2019re using truncated versions of the real thing. Some things, like Grammarly, won\u2019t work at all. Printing from one app might be simple while printing from the next might require a printer plug in to run through. Nothing can just be simple and easy. The pathways between what you\u2019re doing are always complex and not direct. In addition to these frustrations, the keyboard is wonky. It is missing several keys, which will really throw you when you are used to typing a certain way. They also removed the caps lock key and replaced it with a search button, so every time your finger accidentally strays too far from the \u201ca\u201d, you\u2019re opening a new tab and typing a search instead of whatever you were previously doing.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Terrific App, Dashboard Mounting System Could Be Better","text":"I really like the &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; voice-command app that comes with this ZEROTOUCH DASHBOARD CELL PHONE HOLDER (With Voice-Command App for Android Phones).  It was easy to set up on my Galaxy S7 Edge, and it seems to work very well &#34;on the road&#34;.<br \/><br \/>I  haven't tested it a whole lot (because of physical installation issues, more on that later), but it seems to have an excellent, up-to-date GPS Navigator, and a terrific Text Message Handler.  To send or reply to a text, you wave a hand to wake the app, tell it to &#34;Send a message to (name a contact)&#34;, dictate the message, listen to the readback, and answer &#34;yes&#34; to the query &#34;Should I send it&#34;.  If you have the Samsung &#34;S Voice&#34;, it's quite similar, except that &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; notifies you of incoming text messages, and lets you reply to them strictly with voice commands.<br \/><br \/>The &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; app only works when your cellphone is docked with the cellphone car mount base.  Docking and mounting are where I ran into problems.  First, there aren't many places in a Honda Civic that are suitable for a suction-cup-base cellphone holder--at least not if you worry about the suction cup losing its grip and dumping your expensive smartphone on the car floor.<br \/><br \/>Second, the cellphone docks with the car mount base via a thin, adhesive-backed magnetic plate that you're supposed to attach directly to your cellphone or cellphone case.  (Tip: If you're having trouble pairing during setup, place the thin metal plate that attaches to your phone directly atop the round part of the base until the magnet grips.)  Attaching the plate was an issue, because I didn't want to apply it directly to my new phone (and maybe mar the finish).  Applying the plate to my cellphone case worked for a short time, but the adhesive wasn't strong enough to hold the cellphone case through repeated dockings and undockings.  Now the adhesive is worn out and won't adhere to anything.<br \/><br \/>However, there is a workaround.  If only the magnetic plate is docked on the base, the &#34;Zero Touch&#34; app will work whenever your cellphone is NEAR the base--within Bluetooth range, I guess.  So my hands-free calling\/messaging arrangement uses the Honda Civic's two cupholders.  The base with the docking strip goes in one cupholder, and the cellphone with the &#34;Zero Touch&#34; app goes in the other.<br \/><br \/>With this setup, I can use all of the &#34;Zero Touch&#34; features.  Of course, if I want to use the handy &#34;parking location finder&#34; feature, I need to undock the magnetic strip from the base when I leave the car, just as I would if the strip were still attached to my cellphone.<br \/><br \/>The magnetic plate did NOT interfere with my S7 Edge's wireless charging feature, when I had the plate attached to the lower quarter of the cellphone case.  (The &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; app setup has a diagram showing you where to attach the plate, if you use wireless charging.)<br \/><br \/>Because I love the easy-to-use &#34;ZeroTouch&#34; app, but am dissatisfied with the holder mounting arrangement (suction cup and adhesive may not adequately secure the cellphone), I rate this product at 4 stars (&#34;I like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale)."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"This is a fantastic light! Highly recommend!","text":"My main use is lighting for video calls. This light gets super bright and can display a wide range of color temperatures. It comes with a clamp mount for your desk, a remote, a ball bearing head, power adapter with plugs for use in the US, UK, and Europe (you also have the option to power the light with batteries, which aren't included)<br \/><br \/>The remote comes with a magnetic piece that you can attach to the light (or wherever) for convenient storage. I find the remote to be very useful, as many lights I've used are controlled  by an app, a switch on the power wire, or by buttons on the light itself. Having a remote is much better.<br \/><br \/>The included clamp stand can be stretched from ~11 inches to ~32 inches when fully extended, and the ball mount allows you to adjust it to whatever angle is best for you.<br \/><br \/>You also have the option of powering the light with Sony NP-F series batteries. The batteries aren't included, so I wasn\u2019t able to test that. The batteries are completely optional, as the light can be powered via the AC adapter.<br \/><br \/>Having used this light for about a month so far, I do not have any complaints and would highly recommend this."}

Sometimes to wake you need more then whistles + bells. Hoping emulated sunshine would help the cause.. and it paid off!! We had great results. Of course, this is after the headache of getting setting this up!!<br \/><br \/>Not going to lie- setup of alarm was a bit difficult using enclosed instructions- However, if you start by the downloading of the app.. it will walk you thru the step-by-step how too from the app point of you! Ha.. saves a lot of frustration and confusion.<br \/><br \/>Being a non tech human in a technological world- I don\u2019t understand a lot. Only after my visit parent weekend I saw this clock in action: clock allows you to control with Alexa\/cell phone- or, from clock itself (mine uses the Alexa 99% of the time- bc it\u2019s easy + habit forming..you can even snooze clock with Alexa!) She LOVES she can charge phone with this unit.. outlet on back. #\u2019s can be a bit hard to read\/see on lighter colors- esp. yellow.. display should be polar opposite color of the back light IMHO! FM radio.. ehh! But Bluetooth able is bomb!! Looks crazy cool as a piece of art in a dorm room- color swap options are far too fun.. a total novelty! Best yet, 4wk into a 7:40 start for class and hasn\u2019t missed\/tardy x1 time.. WooT!!<br \/><br \/>In order to gain all of its perks .. it\u2019s important to note this is a tech friendly alarm! Be certain the recipient is one who\u2019s tech friendly as well! Possibly not the best option for elderly or those like myself- who struggle with using an iPhone to its potential!! an app along with multiple button options on the device itself\u2026 Is confusing at best for myself- and may be to those in similar situations.<br \/><br \/>Would make a great graduation gift heading off to college or moving out to be solely responsible for getting themselves places on time. This serves a purpose in a really fun way and would be a total hit for recipient.. everywhere you look these are trending!! Hoping info can help your decision- stay safe everyone."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"All-in-One PC for Home Users (Not Gamers), With Easy, Easy Setup","text":"I really like this ACER ASPIRE C24-865-ACi5NT ALL-IN-ONE DESKTOP PC.  It\u2019s my first all-in-one PC, and I love the small footprint, single power cable, and easy, easy setup.  It\u2019s a true plug-and-play machine that takes about 10 minutes to unbox, assemble, and start up.<br \/><br \/>The first boot takes a while, as Win10 Home makes itself presentable, and you need to get a big Win10 update when you first check for system updates, but it\u2019s a terrific machine for home users who aren\u2019t gamers.  (Gamers need powerful, superfast machines with specialized graphics cards.)  This PC is plenty fast for ordinary home users--it boots quickly, and loads files quickly.<br \/><br \/>KEYBOARD AND MOUSE.  I don\u2019t understand the other reviewers\u2019 dislike of the Acer keyboard and mouse.  These work off a dongle (a small radio receiver that you plug into a USB 2.0 port at the back of the monitor) when the mouse is turned on. The dongle is stored inside the mouse\u2019s battery compartment.  Both keyboard and mouse are sensitive, and I actually like the feel of the keyboard better than the feel of a very nice Verbatim quiet-key keyboard (with mouse) that I own that also works from a radio dongle.<br \/><br \/>The keyboard does have square, flat keys that aren\u2019t at all elegant-looking.  However, if you\u2019re used to typing on an iPad\u2019s virtual keyboard or on a laptop, you won\u2019t mind the flat keys.  The dongle eliminates two cables (one for the keyboard, one for the mouse), so you can move both mouse and keyboard off your desk if you aren\u2019t using the PC.<br \/><br \/>DISPLAY:  Not being an expert on technical display specs, all I can say is that the display has accurate color and excellent high-definition images.  The size of the display (23.8\u201d) is perfect for a PC that lives on your desk (where you\u2019re always sitting close to it).  Also, the edge-to-edge display makes this look like an expensive monitor!<br \/><br \/>OPERATING SYSTEM, CAMERA, JACKS AND PORTS:  Windows 10 Home is powerful enough, and full-featured enough, for my general home use.  I use this PC for checking mail, connecting to the Internet, playing a few simple games (e.g., Microsoft Solitaire), occasionally meeting with people via Skype, keeping financial records, and composing a few letters.  The system comes with free online Microsoft Word, and with a 1-month free trial of Microsoft Office 365 ($99 a year if you keep it).<br \/><br \/>Wireless is built in.  My PC had no difficulty connecting to my home network--connections are handled by the Win10 operating system.  Stereo sound is built in, and sounds good to my non-audiophile ears.<br \/><br \/>The webcam is kind of pathetic, with very poor picture quality.  However, people are recognizable, and you can easily replace the webcam with a better one. The webcam  isn\u2019t built-in, but attaches magnetically to the monitor and plugs into a USB port in back.<br \/><br \/>On the back of the monitor, the PC has an SD card reader, an audio jack (for headphones, and I think microphone too), a Kensington lock, an ethernet port, a PS2 port, a VGA port, an HDMI\/DP port, and four USB ports (two 2.0 ports, with one being used by the dongle; and two 3.0 ports, with one being used by the webcam).  If four USB ports aren\u2019t enough for you, you can easily use one or more of the USB ports to add USB-port hubs.<br \/><br \/>STORAGE:  The hard drive (inside the monitor) has a 1 terabyte capacity, which will store tons of photos and doc files.  If you need more storage, you can add a USB storage drive.<br \/><br \/>SUMMARY:  This is an extremely well-thought-out general purpose PC.  It\u2019s a space-saver, and it\u2019s extraordinarily easy to set up.  The only hard thing is understanding that the keyboard and mouse work by radio, and locating the receiver dongle inside the mouse."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Cordless Flex Adds Alexa Safely to Powder Room, Needs No Accessory Shelf","text":"The ECHO FLEX is perfect for my powder room.  It plugs directly into an electrical outlet above the vanity sink, and it doesn\u2019t require either (1) a cord, or (2) an accessory shelf to hold it out of the way (above the vanity countertop).  Thus it reduces clutter around the sink; and it is safer than a regular Echo or Echo Dot in this location.  (You can\u2019t accidentally knock it into a sinkful of water.)<br \/><br \/>The Echo Flex connects through the Alexa app, and does everything that the other Echo devices do.  For my household, this means turning lights or tv on and off; setting timers and reminders; asking for local weather or traffic information; checking the time; asking general knowledge questions; doing math and recipe calculations; playing music; and \u201cdropping in\u201d on Echo devices in other rooms (using the Echos as an intercom).  The speaker isn't up to audiophile standards for playing music, but it's fine for playing casual background music and for hearing the spoken word.<br \/><br \/>The Echo Flex is especially great for my husband, who is hard of hearing.  When he\u2019s in the powder room now, he can hear me when I \u201cdrop in\u201d even if the water is running.  The Echo Flex is located only about a yard away.  (He can\u2019t hear me when I \u201cdrop in\u201d to a bedroom device that is located about 15 feet away.)<br \/><br \/>Setup takes about 5 minutes if you have already downloaded the Alexa app.  After you plug the Echo Flex in, it advises you to open the Alexa app to complete the setup.  The app takes you the rest of the way through setup."}

Also the controls on this thing are brutal, for over $300 Samsung couldn\u2019t put in an onboard screen help configure, either on the remote or on the speaker!? All your get it LED lights, so if you forget the sequence or lose the manual good luck. Sound is much better than on board TV speakers, but definitely lacks the bass a subwoofer system will have.

(Once you turn it on, if a call comes in that is not recognized by the box, it plays a message that tries to ward off the caller by asking them to enter zero if they think they are legit -- and call back, whereupon the caller will be admitted for answering. Note: we have NOT tried this feature. I expect it will work as described.)<br \/><br \/>The box can handle up to 10,000 numbers, which is great. In a month we have received 92 calls and rejected 66.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Durable construction - with a one year warranty from Belkin","text":"Not listed at the Belkin site for Iconia any longer. I went to do a bit of research at Belkin after doing a test drive with the product (11.6 x 7.7 x 0.7 inches.  Belkin only lists the SLIM FOLIO STAND 10.1 for the Galaxy. That might be due to the one problem I have. I have to stick my finger under the screen cutout because the opening is not wide enough.<br \/><br \/>If you are looking for a sleek, minimal folio (and stand) this is for you. I wouldn't want to drop it from a height, I'd want something with bulk or padding. It's ultra-thin (half an inch before adding the tablet & lightweight (about 8oz); So no accommodation ANYTHING else.<br \/><br \/>The cover folds over, with a soft inner lining, to easily protect from scratches and is secured with a subtle elastic band instead of magnets (extra security).<br \/><br \/>The flap that folds inside the folio to tuck the tablet in. Totally unnecessary, and just ads bulk, as the fit is so tight that tablet is NEVER coming out without the help of another person. That being a negative for someone who is looking to use the folio only part time.  Fyi - the memory card slot is also accessible through a cutout.<br \/><br \/>The two small airvents are a great idea, they come into play when using the folio as a stand - I would suggest to Belkin venting more of the section.<br \/><br \/>Multi-angled stand. It works perfect and simple : a typing angle, viewing angle and several angles in between - winner!<br \/><br \/>Not crazy about the feel of the case (neoprene rubber) - it feels kinda polyester.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Brilliant","text":"Truly what's not to love? This is the perfect desk top computer for your college student. It's also the perfect desktop for any business with a marketing department. I watched this video and was totally hooked. I have been doing PowerPoint presentations for 24 years and this blows it out of the water.<br \/><br \/>What finally hooked me to it's creative potential at the office was watching two 3 minute videos on YouTube:<br \/>&#34;HP Sprout Review&#34; and &#34;Using the Capture Feature on Sprout by HP&#34; - amazing<br \/><br \/>Hook up was easy as I expected about 20 minutes to unbox everything and less than an hour to get everything running<br \/><br \/>Now, right now I am not in a financial picture to buy the 3D printer or imaging stand (even tho the prices are not outrageous),but I can still get a designed printed by establishing a free account with HP's 3D printing partner. FYI the Dremel is the highest rated model by '3D Engineer' just go to their sight and search &#34;dremel-idea-builder-review&#34; it gave me a lot of easily understandable information if I decide to go that route. You can also go to the Dremel site '3dprinter dot dremel' the videos there helped me learn a lot about how this 3D printing works. Lastly, I read a informational article at 'makezine' that you can find on the internet  &#34;dremel-3d-printer-idea-builder&#34;.<br \/><br \/>Ok, so the next stop on my journey of discovery was HP where I searched 'Sprout'. So I watched the videos and skimmed the tech stuff. WELL worth your time - I truly think it saved me a TON of time.  If object design is your thing or you are looking to get your high school or college kid into computer design this desk top will hook them. It's just so creative! One tip when getting started, on the HP site I put a query of &#34;Sprout&#34; in the search engine and got a nice small list of use links PLUS a dedicated SPROUT FORUM for users where HP folks jump in all the time with helpful information and trouble shooting help.<br \/><br \/>Ok, I really wanted to so how the 3D works so I created a free account with the HP 3D printer partner  Sculpteo - it could not be easier. First stop for me was  searching the Sculpteo site for '3D Printing Price and Payment Methods' and 'help\/#price-calculation'.  You can see it doesn't have to be ridiculously expensive - but it can be - the larger the object the bigger the cost. The site is very user friendly and immersive, even if you don't plan to print right off take a look, it is fascinating. A very good article &#34;Sculpteo Opens its 3D Printing Cloud Engine to the Public, BY ANDREW WHEELER MAY 8, 2015&#34; explained how this all works. Also &#34;HP & Sculpteo Partner to 3D Print Directly from Sprout BY DAVIDE SHER AUGUST 3, 2015&#34;. Both are most helpful.

Although my old bulb didn't burn out or pop, I got a warning message from the projector that the lamp lifetime was up.  And what a difference a new lamp makes. The new lamp was brighter the color accuracy was much improved compared to the old lamp I replaced.  Apparently these lamps lose their brightness and ability to provide true white over time.  The picture looked as good as when I first used my projector brand new.  It's better to buy the bulb with the housing such as this product rather than just the bulb alone.  There's significant precision in the design of projector bulbs and their housing.  The less you handle it the better. A drop-in replacement is the way to go. Strong burning smell at first which disappeared after the first day of use.  I recall similar smell when I first used my GT-750E."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent sound quality; easy to operate; AM radio does not work in U.S.","text":"This was much heavier and larger than I expected.  It would be nice if it had a carrying handle on top, but since it runs on house current and not batteries, it's not portable, so the handle would only be useful for moving it.  The weight is probably because of the high quality built-in speakers.  The sound quality is excellent, compared to even good quality computer speakers.  It also sounds better than my stereo speakers.  The manual leaves a little to be desired, but the system is pretty easy to operate and most operations are intuitive.  The biggest disappointment I had is that the AM radio does not work; it is apparently set up for European standards and won't work in the U.S. from what I was able to find out. It is disclosed in the description that AM is not available in the U.S.  It does get FM stations with good fidelity and has an FM aerial.  There is an external input on the back, so you can play through the unit, which you might want to do because of the good sound quality.  They also include a connecting cable for this, which is a nice bonus.  Unfortunately no external output, which could be handy, but not a necessity.  Just insert a CD and it starts playing the CD right away.  Insert a USB stick and it starts playing any audio files on the stick.  At first I thought there was no slot for a USB stick, as it is not identified that way in the manual; it is identified as a phone charging port, a U disk port (maybe they meant USB) and for I-Pod reading.  This is just a one-CD at a time system; would be great if it could take multiple CDs.  The remote is okay and has all the functions you'll need, but is a little confusing at first.  I didn't test the Bluetooth connection capability to a cell phone, as I don't think I would use that function.  If you want a really nice sounding CD player than also handles other audio files on a USB or SD card that also has FM radio and you don't care about the AM radio not working, this is worth getting.  Would give this 5 stars if the AM radio worked.  This is actually a VW automobile disk player that has been converted by putting a wooden case around it and adding quality speakers; very clever idea, especially since this is a pretty decent CD player.  Also they include a demo CD with 18 tracks of popular well known songs, which is another bonus."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Super basic dash cam; basic setup is relatively quick; memory card NOT included","text":"[[VIDEOID:8a05ea6494b6e1be751fa342867838c]] I purchased this to replace my wonderful DOD TECH LS460W dash cam that broke and which I absolutely loved.  This package includes the camera, user manual, suction mount, and car power adapter. I had to supply my own memory card, so I used the 64GB ADATA microSD card from my previous dash cam. It can take up to a 256GB card per the manual.<br \/><br \/>I've used this four about a week so far (see video) without fully completing all the setup options. My plan is to eventually set this up fully in my house by using the 12-volt DC (direct current) receptacle of my [[ASIN:B00CMP3Z4E Clore JNC300XL 'Jump-N-Carry' 900 Peak Amp Ultraportable 12V Jump Starter with Light, CEC Compliant]] so that I don't have to sit in the car in the cold selecting the available options.<br \/><br \/>I was able to use this within about 15 minutes of receiving this by not changing any defaults. After unpacking everything, cleaning my windshield behind the rearview mirror, and running through the language, date, time, and formatting the SD card, I began recording. Note that this is supposed to turn on when the car turns on. It does not do that. In fact, sometimes I have to press the power button several ties before it will come on. I do not mind if I have to press it once but rarely does the camera come on the first time. The red recording light should come up automatically. If it does not, then the record button also has to be pressed.<br \/><br \/>Below are the PROS and CONS.<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/>- Setup is relatively easy by following the manual's instructions.<br \/><br \/>-  This one has a 1080p wide-angle video image as long as that is what is selected in the setup.<br \/><br \/>- The controls are user friendly.<br \/><br \/>- The camera is compact and has a relatively thin and tiny profile.<br \/><br \/>- The camera secures tightly in the dock. I did have to turn the knob on the mount because it was originally flopping around as a result of the mount socket being loose.<br \/><br \/>- No shaking is visible in the recorded picture which surprised me.<br \/><br \/>- The power cable is extra-long so it can be routed through the headliner of the car. I cannot do this since I have a convertible.<br \/><br \/>- The camera has a loop record feature so that it overwrites the previous recordings when the disk gets full.<br \/><br \/>-There's also a G sensor option that forces emergency recording on impact. Of course the only way to know if this works is to get into an accident.<br \/><br \/>- Date and time are recorded if set. I'm not sure how it remembers the date and time when the card is turned off because it does not have an internal battery and my 12V port is not powered by my car battery when my car is turned off.<br \/><br \/>- The camera has three modes - video recording, photo (to take a still photo), and video playback (to see what you recorded).<br \/><br \/>- The camera has a motion activated feature that's for use when not in motion. This only works as long as the car is running, is hooked to a battery pack such as the JNC 300XL, or a car whose cigarette lighter does not turn off when the car is turned off and it is set.<br \/><br \/>-  The camera records sound in the cabin.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/>- There is no GPS stamp on this which means if one gets in an accident or captures an image, the GPS location will not be known.<br \/><br \/>- There is no speed recorded.<br \/><br \/>- There is no internal battery.<br \/><br \/>- The manual does not specify how many languages are supported.<br \/><br \/>- If the 12V connector in the car does not turn off when the car turns off, it is recommended that this dash cam be unplugged or it might drain the car battery.<br \/><br \/>- Exposure to extreme heat or extreme cold reduces the lifespan of the camera (as per manual warning). I believe this is to be expected.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I wanted a dash cam that was easy to set up and was relatively cheap. I do not need all the bells and whistles such as recording when parked, in cabin recording,  an on-board battery, a rear camera, wifi, etc. This one fits my needs so far due to its simplicity. The only thing I miss is the GPS and speed stamps of my other dash cam. Those I feel should be mandatory on all dash cambs. I also miss the automatic start when the care turns on as this does not work that way on my car.<br \/><br \/>I will update this review if this dash cam fails prematurely. I expect to get at least 2 years of service out of this unit.  I got my other dash cam in January 2015 and it lasted until November 2021, which is almost 6 years."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Probably great for a professional","text":"I was in the market for a new camera and when I saw this bag in the Vine program I thought I would snap it up. I did get my Canon Rebel (thanks Amazon!) and several lenses to boot (in preparation for my trip this month to Israel). Although the quality of the bag is good, the size to me is really inconvenient. First, it is shaped like a back pack, which makes it kind of big. I am not sure if I am going to be able to bring this on the plane with me (as the boarding guidelines state 1 carry-on and I have a purse and laptop I am bringing). In addition, there are straps and zippered compartments which are not really conveniently placed. It's not an easy bag to get your gear in and out of. I see this bag as a great tool to have if you are backpacking as you have a place to hang a tripod and there is a small storage area if you wanted to bring a snack with you. But for someone like me, who wants it for sightseeing\/traveling, I think a more conventional camera bag would have done the trick better."}
{"rating":2.0,"title":"An interesting item but finicky","text":"Review update:<br \/>After using the keyboard for a little while, some of the keys stopped functioning and rolling up or bending the keyboard for storage or moving it, permanently damaged the product.

Wouldn't recommend it unless you've been dying to have a quirky unresponsive keyboard you can take with you.<br \/><br \/>------------<br \/>When I set to order a flexible keyboard, I mainly wanted it for the novelty. That is probably for the best since this keyboard is very unique. It lights up, is bendable and has nice texture to it. However, the keys are a little unresponsive unless you press them from a certain angle. Also the keyboard is a little larger than normal keyboards because of the extra inch and a half of covered wires at the end.<br \/>  If you are looking for a keyboard which is for gaming or for typing very fast, this is not the keyboard for you. If you want something cool and easy to pack or move, then you will likely love it."}

It's lined with a soft, fuzzy material - an elastic band on side keeps your tools in place and the other side has a handy mesh flap perfect for combs, etc. I great zipper keeps everything where it needs to be and then... a super handy handle.  I am very, very happy with this purchase as it fit my needs so well.  I will, of course, update my review should new info seem useful."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"It's a nice keyboard complete with cover and back-lit LEDs","text":"This keyboard is nice. I had previously been using a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse by Jellycomb, which were fantastic for being quiet, but they have issues after about 3 months of use.<br \/><br \/>I figured a wired keyboard would be less likely to have the same ghosting issues and I wanted another quiet keyboard. This one is slim profile, has cool blacklighting, and is very quiet when the cover is on.<br \/><br \/>However, while I like the cover, it is rather thick, making typing a bit difficult. It's hard to explain, but it's like the edges can get caught on the cover. Still a nice keyboard but it could problems if you're gaming or trying to type fast a lot. Alternatively, you can take off the cover and it's not too bad. But I keep it on to keep it quiet.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>- quiet<br \/>- cool leds<br \/>- slim profile<br \/>- has cover and it's durable<br \/>- cool styling of the keys<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>- hard to type (with cover)<br \/>- a little louder without the cover"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A Fantastic, Well thought out Tripod","text":"I have three main uses for tripods, food photography, nature photography and to hold up a spotting scope.  This tripod succeeds wonderfully at two of those.  It is great for nature photography and supporting the spotting scope.  I am 6' 3\" and I love that height of this tripod. even without extending the center post, I can comfortably use the tripod when standing.<br \/><br \/>This is a fantastic birdwatching tripod for my spotting scope.  The carbon fiber material is light and rugid. Vanguard has remembered the little things, for example, the upper legs are padded which is huge in when trying to spot an owl in Minnesota at twenty below.  The insulation makes the tripod much more comfortable to handle, equally when shooting images of Northern lights.<br \/><br \/>The legs are fairly sturdy although I feel that here is a little more play in the carbon fiber over my older aluminum, Bogen tripod. I was a little disappointed that there are just a few angle settings for the legs.  They click into 30 and about 60 degrees.  It would be nice to have more granular settings, so I find myself altering leg lengths more than my other tripod. The feet are well designed with hard steel spikes with nice rubber feet for indoor uses.  Both options allow for good stable footings.<br \/><br \/>Also there are some great other details like leveling bubbles on the top of the tripod and ball head.  Also, I like that they though to include a hook at the bottom of the center post for adding stability weights.  The leg releases are easy to use and have held tight during all my time in the field with the tripod.<br \/><br \/>Where I wish they had put more into this tripod is the ball head. It doesn't seem to live up to the tripod body.  I miss a pan handle and while I appreciate the feel and functionality of the locking knobs, it just seems like it is not the pro quality of the rest of the tripod.  There is a second leveling bubble on the head itself which is fantastic.  But probably the biggest drawback is the quick release plate.  It is not quick at all, it requires quite a bit of screwing with thumbscrew to attach.  Also there is not set screw on the \"quick\" release plate.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>+ Height<br \/>+ padded legs for comfort in cold weather<br \/>+ Light Weight<br \/>+ Great feet, both the grippy robber shoes and the steel spikes<br \/>+ built in leveling bubbles<br \/>+ Functional and strong leg locks<br \/>+ built in hook on bottom of center post<br \/>+ Second leveling bubble on the head<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>- No built in strap<br \/>- Carrying case is ok (this is more a neutral than a con)<br \/>- the head is not great<br \/>- limited leg angles<br \/>- Head could be better<br \/>- Somewhat awkward and slow quick release plates<br \/>- Lacks a panning arm.<br \/><br \/>In General, this is an awesome tripod, but for the money I would have expected a little more, especially a strap and a better head unit.  But I have to admit I love this tripod.  I would have put 4.5 stars if possible, but for $500 my expectation for a \"Professional\" tripod head is a little higher.  But for my uses it's awesome, it holds the Spotting Scope will but again, lack of a panning arm hinders it.  From the shoulders down, the best I've seen."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Professional worthy backpack for duel use..","text":"This is a smart\/sleek looking backpack\/work bag if there ever was one! Gone are the days of the corporate world only utilizing a briefcase..As this is a hip (maybe even yuppie or, millennial..?!) nice alternative to that!<br \/>TBH- this isn\u2019t your kids \u201ctake to school\u201d backpack unless, you\u2019re adulting in school- it definitely has that feel for sure. This would be a perfect gift for a graduate to use in college or, one commuting to work in city or, to hip new job- it most definitely carries professional vibe look but, does it in a hip way! This would be ideal for anyone carrying more than just a laptop to\/from work- as it has plenty of safe and secure room for multiple electronics or, camera equipment, and would be a dream for professional who travels for work.. it has the strap to attach it to luggage and makes navigating the airport a lot more hands free!<br \/>This comes in two sizes so it can fit the needs of your computer and equipment.Surprising, it can be worn just like a backpack- (Including strap to hold it secure) and yet, as you walk into office- it transforms into corporate world with ease! This is the smaller of the 2 sizes and yet, it feels roomy enough to fit your laptop and even better, there is still extra room for all creature comfort\u2019s needed. My son uses this backpack in the larger size and the two sitting side-by-side are very comparable. I appreciate the fact that both are made with the same attention to detail and other then, the overall measurement- from what I can see- you will get the same bag and its integrity.<br \/><br \/>The outer layer feels almost neoprene-ish and I love how entire pack is formed\/molded to have a harder exterior- it stand on its own which is so  convenient to get things in and out as needed and also gives extra protection. The zippers are smooth and we haven\u2019t had any issue catching the inner and ever dreaded inside zipper lining. We first were using a leather backpack to perform same duties as it looked nice yet, but was not reinforced or practical and was so slouchy.. this looks just as nice as the same style in leather because.. it\u2019s not marked up with cheesy colors or branding (we got solid black) and are thrilled with the choice..<br \/>The nice thing is- this looks like professional bag but, has all the smaller sections and creatures comforts that are appreciated in a backpack. I love the front pocket- great for wallet\/ID\/airline info\/ Cel phone\/keys\/etc.. all in there neat little spot. Im telling you, those with OCD will love this bag!!<br \/><br \/>The bonus feature with this bag- is the usb charging port. NO! This isn\u2019t a Tesla magic bag.. that magically provides power. You must add a battery charge pack to the inside outlet. And yess, you\u2019ll have to charge up the battery pack as needed- BUT,  if you do this and have a device  running now such as\u2026 Delayed in an airport or, no access to an outlet \u2013 you can plug into your own bag and keep device running strong. No, we did not use this flying with the airlines yet as, I\u2019m hoping there will be no issue with the extra battery supply? ( I know there were issues with batteries combusting mid flight\u2026 I\u2019m guessing this is not one of them?! )<br \/>If you are looking to get or give a nice \u201ccorporate style\u201d bag with all the bells and whistle\u2019s\u2026this is hands down worth it and one that I stand behind and feel, will not disappoint !<br \/>*The only suggestion I have for manufacture would be: include a battery boost pack with the sale of the backpack and have this item be all inclusive.. it would also assure your battery pack would fit and show where\/how it fits\/connects.. and keeps things simple. I had to buy a separate battery pack boost and make a guesstimate on what size would fit\u2026 Id like to see it \u201ccomplete when giving the bag as a gift. I personally would like this to have everything needed and ready upon receiving. So, Add the battery pack, Since it\u2019s not included. Or, the seller could make it be an \u201cadd-on\u201d option for a few more $."}

It looked perfect for my oldest son who is a huge 80's music fan and thought he should hear it in its original format.  We were excited to unbox it and play the two albums we picked up at the used book store.  First impressions were OK.  The case looks nice and love the two speakers built in.  Opening it, we were underwhelmed by the plastic turntable, stylus arm and rather cheap looking controls.  But we were still excited.<br \/><br \/>The sound was also a little disappointing.  The two speakers are underpowered and all high end so it was pretty tinny.  But the absolute worst was that they stylus is so head light that it skipped constantly.  We put a small glass bead on it and the weight actually slowed the turntable.  We backed off and placed a quarter on it and it played about right.  But again, I was underwhelmed by the underpowered turntable.  Also, we noted that one of the spongy pads on the turn table was not installed properly and put a list to the album.  We fixed that and fixed the quarter to the stylus and we were able to get it to play through Adam Ant's Friend or Foe album.  The scratchy quality of between songs brought me back 40 years to my own first phonograph, which I think was pretty crappy, but probably better than this one.<br \/><br \/>It works, its nostalgic.  We have had fun and will probably get an album at every used bookstore, garage sale, or antique store we find them in, but we will need to upgrade if he goes beyond just enjoying the novelty of it."}

I was very surprised when I pulled this out of the box - even empty, this bag is incredibly bulky. And while the construction is sturdy, it's made from a material that almost reminds me of my old diaper bags. The word \"discreet\" is used in the marketing for this bag, and I can't imagine that at all. Even with my smaller camera and a few personal items, I am absolutely overtaken by this bag.

It's nice when a product is truly plug and play, which this is.  I plugged it in and it was immediately available.  I copy nearly 300 gig of data to it.  It took a while at USB 2 speeds, but it worked flawlessly.  I also played a movie from it and it worked perfectly I tested this on Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10.  On XP it is recognized by Windows, but thinks that it isn't formatted (which it is).  Probably would not work properly on XP.  In Windows 7, the driver for it automatically installed in just seconds.  On Windows 10, I didn't have to do anything; it was immediately recognized.  SSD (solid state) is the only way to go these days and I think that in a very short time the mechanical hard drives with spinning platters will be a thing of the past.  Of course being solid state, it is completely silent and it produces almost no heat at all.  It is not unlike a USB stick, except that it has a short cord that it needs to plug in.  The cord is a bit short (around 16 inches), which is my only gripe with this product.  Being that it is advertised as portable, you wouldn't want to carry around a long cord with it anyway, so that could be an advantage.  The unit is very small; about the size of 2 USB sticks.  I acquired an SSD drive of the same capacity (500 GB) a couple years back and it is twice the physical size of this unit.  Technological advances have steadily decreased the sizes of storage while increasing the capacity.  This has 3 included files for enabling security on the device (one for Windows and one for MAC).  The third file is for Android devices and it is just a text file with a link where you can apparently get what you need.  Great little device.

I use this to switch between PCs; some reviewers mentioned trouble with MACs.  The only real issue I have encountered is that if I power up a computer that is off and I am currently switched to another computer, when I go back to the one that was off (that is now on), the screen resolution has dropped.  If I switch to the turned off computer while it still off and power up and boot up before switching away, there is no issue and then I can switch back and forth all day with everything staying as it should be.  It's just a very minor annoyance.  If the computers you are switching between are always on, it would never be an issue.  The other thing that I found out is that for me the audio was not of much use.  The reason is that I am often listening to music on one computer; when I wanted to switch to another computer to do some work, the sound stopped, obviously because now I was on another computer that didn't have music playing.  I ended up just hooking up 3 sets of speakers for my 3 computers.  A lot of space used up, but a better solution for me.  The sound situation is not a problem with the switch, as it was doing exactly what it should by looking for output from the line out on the computer that you are switched to.  Some reviewers mentioned problems with delay in the hotkey switching.  I haven't noticed this and usually it takes no more than one second to switch.  My switch uses ScrLk twice followed by the port number the computer is on.  I have tried out two more expensive switches that don't have hotkey capability and you have to press a button on the switch.  With Trendnet switches, you can do either - use the keyboard sequence or press the physical key on the switch.  I have had this switch in service for a number of years and the only physical issue I have encountered is that once in a while the master keyboard and mouse connections loosen up and have to be re-seated.  The switch has given me many years of flawless operation and so far has proven to perform better than much more expensive switches.  Very good value for the price and I highly recommend it.  I like Trendnet equipment so far and have some other products of theirs that also work very well."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Freestanding Number Pad Works With Windows Apps, Built-in Calculator","text":"This MAGICFORCE MECHANICAL USB WIRED NUMERIC KEYPAD (21 Keys with LED Backlighting; for Windows Laptops, Desktops) is a freestanding plug-and-play number pad for your Windows PC.  Plug it into a USB port (using the included cable), and you immediately have a comfortably angled, dedicated number pad that works with apps (e.g., Word), and with the built-in Windows calculator.<br \/><br \/>The backlit number keys are the same size as, and feel much the same as, the number keys on a standard, high-quality mechanical PC keyboard.  The number pad is mounted on an angled, clear plastic stand that makes it easy to use for inputting lots of numbers.<br \/><br \/>The keypad adds a number pad if your PC keyboard doesn\u2019t have one, or frees you from messing with the NumLock key on a PC keyboard that does. The keypad performs the standard operations (+, -, *, \/), and totals with the return key.  A backspace key makes it easy to correct entry mistakes on the built-in Windows calculator.  To enter certain special characters (e.g., the dollar sign), you hold the Fn key down and press the key with the character (e.g., $) on the keycap."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Case Fits iPad 2, Bluetooth Keyboard Works With iPad 2","text":"This polyurethane Targus Versavu Keyboard Case is beautiful, with imitation-leather exterior and suede-like \"soft touch\" interior.  A hard shell (also with imitation-leather exterior) holds the iPad firmly in place, yet the iPad can be easily removed.  The shell is attached at the circular hole shown in the product photos; the hole allows the Apple logo to show through.  The shell rotates (with the iPad inserted) a full 360 degrees, so that the stand and keyboard can be used when the iPad is oriented either horizontally or vertically.<br \/><br \/>The lightweight keyboard is about the same size as the keyboard on my Toshiba netbook.  The flat, non-contoured keys are reasonably comfortable to use.  The keyboard is surrounded by a raised edge, to prevent scratches or damage to the iPad screen.  The keyboard must be charged independently (using the included USB cable, attached to your computer).  The keyboard will give a low-charge warning at 15% power, and shut down at 10% power.<br \/><br \/>This case (with cutouts for buttons, switches, rear camera, and charger plug) fits my iPad 2 perfectly, and the Bluetooth keyboard connects with my iPad 2.  I didn't expect it to work, because the iPad 2 is equipped with Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR technology, while the iPad 3 is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 technology, and the product description says that the case requires an iPad 3.  The case does NOT have an automatic iPad Wake\/Sleep switch that operates when you open the cover; however, the keyboard puts itself to sleep after 10 minutes of inactivity.<br \/><br \/>I like this case and all of its features, but it's not the \"perfect\" iPad 2 case.  It adds weight and bulk, and apparently--judging from other reviewers' statements--the manufacturer recommends against using the case for anything but display (no carrying the case around in a backpack, tote, or bag).  Because the keyboard works well, I rate it at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Sheer Convenience of Wireless Photo Uploading Compensates for Drain on Camera Battery","text":"This EYE-FI MOBI PRO 32GB WIFI SDHC CARD replaces my \"legacy\" [[ASIN:B003DV4234 Eye-Fi Connect X2 Wi-Fi SDHC Card]] (which still works perfectly after 3+ years of regular use).  These Eye-Fi SDHC cards are incredibly convenient for a casual photographer like myself.  The photos are immediately uploaded to my computer or to the Eye-Fi Cloud, right after they're shot.  The photos can be shared immediately, and I don't have to remove the card from my camera to transfer the photos to a PC or mobile device.  (The Eye-Fi cards can also be read directly from a photo card reader or from a PC card reader slot.)<br \/><br \/>This Eye-Fi Mobi Pro card is much, much faster than my \"legacy\" Eye-Fi card.  The Mobi Pro works just like the older card in my Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX2S camera. (The Eye-Fi web site has a long, long list of compatible cameras you can check before buying any Eye-Fi card.)<br \/><br \/>Uploads to the Eye-Fi Cloud seem almost instantaneous, and the transfers to my PC take about a quarter of the time required by the older card.  The wireless transmissions do tend to drain my camera battery though.  You'll need to recharge frequently or keep extra batteries on hand.<br \/><br \/>The Eye-Fi Mobi Pro app transfers your photos and videos directly into \"Eye-Fi Pictures\", \"Eye-Fi RAW\", and \"Eye-Fi Videos\" folders on your PC.  The software's default setting groups the transferred files into subfolders of these folders by date.<br \/><br \/>The Mobi Pro app also uploads your photos to the Eye-Fi Cloud and groups them by date.  In the Eye-Fi Cloud you can do simple editing (rotate, crop), add captions, and create albums.  You get a one-year free subscription to the Eye-Fi Cloud with each Mobi Pro card; renewals are $4.99 a month, or $49.99 a year.  The Eye-Fi Cloud is a convenience, but your Mobi Pro card will continue to be completely functional if you decide that you don't need the Eye-Fi Cloud storage.  You can upload to the Eye-Fi Cloud from anywhere, not just from your home network.<br \/><br \/>You get the Mobi Pro app\/software by going to the web address printed on the box (just below the space for the included card reader).  The software is clean and simple, with settings for uploading and downloading photos--automatically or manually--to either the Eye-Fi Cloud, your PC, or both.<br \/><br \/>I always have to fuss for a while to get any Eye-Fi software set up properly.  (Tip:  Don't try to set up the Eye-Fi Mobi app on two PCs at once, with both PCs turned on.  This confuses the software, and also the wireless connections.  I had to uninstall the software from one PC, and recycle my router because my PC lost the ability to communicate with the router.  The price I paid for stupidity!)<br \/><br \/>Ever since I got my first Eye-Fi card, I haven't wanted to use anything else in my camera.  This Eye-Fi Mobi Pro card is tremendously advanced over that first card, in both speed and versatility, and I love it even more."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Very Nice Sound, Very Portable, Not Very Loud, But Overall a Nice Speaker System","text":"This has proven to be a very nice little acquisition.  We got it primarily as a way to unlock the songs on our iPods so we could share them, or enjoy music without being tethered to headphones, but it has ended up being our bed stand iPhone charger and portable music player.<br \/><br \/>The sound put out by these speakers has a Bose-like quality (not exactly Bose equivalent, but a similar, warm, full sound.)  This is not a particularly loud sound system, but it does fill our small bedroom adequately to a reasonable volume.  It will not fill a large room or outdoor area for sure, or belt out heavy metal, but does great at an adult contemporary listening level.<br \/><br \/>After getting this, one thing became quickly evident.  The lack of a remote kind of sucks.  At first I figured it wouldn't be a problem, but since you must use the controls on the ipod, (the speakers only have volume and power controls built in) you need to move to the speakers to skip songs, change volume or turn off.  This doesn't seem like a big idea, and for the price, it is understandable that there is no remote, but I found that it is worth the extra money to get a speaker system with a remote.<br \/><br \/>One thing I really like about it is the portability and the ability to run off of batteries.  We have used it a couple times at night to play owl calls to hear owls call back to us. Also, since it is so portable we move it all around the house and garage which is very handy.<br \/><br \/>Pros:<br \/>Nice full sound (although not overly loud)<br \/>Highly portable<br \/>Battery power option<br \/>Nice and small<br \/>Well designed<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>No Remote<br \/>Picks up dust quickly, hard to keep clean<br \/>Limited controls, you must use controls on iPod<br \/>No equalizer controls<br \/><br \/>All in all, it fills a niche for us and we are happy with the quality of the product an the sound.

The strap holds tightly and releases fairly well.  The swivel head again does not seem to be the most robust manufacturing, but it locks well even with it's plastic parts and is ultimately workable.<br \/><br \/>The mount is easy to use, took just seconds to master the controls.

This CD player is attached as one part of an entire stereo system.<br \/><br \/>The only thing I don't like is that if my electricity goes out when the CD player is OFF, the CD player comes ON by itself when the electricity returns. Therefore, I have to remember to check this every time I come home and discover my electricity went out. I'm not sure why this happens.  Perhaps others know the techology behind this."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Wow, it works!","text":"Needed just this sort of splitter to hook a Roku and a Kindle Fire HD to my not-so-new Sony TV. It works great. Plugged the Roku, which is the most-used of the two devices, into Input 1 and the Fire into Input 2. I don't even need to use the remote. Roku is always left on and the Kindle Fire, when HDMI cable is attached to it from the switcher, appears automatically. Unplug the Fire HDMI cable and the Roku pops back into service. I did have to buy a cable to connect my single HDMI output from the TV to the switcher. I purchased a 3-foot cable for $1.71, including shipping, on Amazon and it works like a charm. Picture quality is great even though the 3-foot cable isn't heavy duty. Would highly recommend this unit."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Wall cord cover D Line","text":"If I could rate this 10 stars, I probably would... of course, time will be the true test!  I had some really ugly black cable cords just sitting along the floor.  Ugly to say the least.  So, I thought I would try these.  I just installed this along my base board (looks like quarter round) and it PERFECTLY holds and hides the cords.  I have two cable lines and a very small, flat land line cord in it... plenty of room for another cable if necessary.  There are no instructions.. but it's pretty easy.  There is a clear film on the outside\/front - the back is a the self stick.  I was placing it on a painted, non textured wall - so it's very flat and the perfect material for this use.  A couple of things I learned as I was placing it... it worked best for me to cord up the holder before sticking to the wall - IMPORTANT - the sticky back is SOLID - NO repositioning at all. You want to make sure you have shoved up against the last one you placed as tightly as possible - you will still see the seam between each length - but less so if you carefully, firmly place each piece. Before removing the sticky back I \"placed\" it in position to see if I liked it and it would work.  Good thing, because once you remove the sticky back, it is NOT coming off without the sheet rock in torn pieces... just fyi.  I chose to position the opening part of the D tube facing up to make it easier to put another cord in or take one out... personal choice.  The ad says it is paintable and that is what I will try next.  Having said that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful - and I am eager to see if this will stand the test of time and use.. meaning.. cords pulled, etc.  I see no reason why you couldn't use this going up a wall (thinking of TV that has been hung on wall, etc - personal taste - but remember, the sticky tape is solid and won't be removed without tearing\/damaging paint.  As for textured surfaces - like wall texture, I am thinking that as positive as this sticky tape is, as long as it's not too textured, it should work - but to be honest, I have not tried it on a textured surface.  As with most things that use a form of sticky tape, the smoother the surface, the better it will stick.)  I hope this info was helpful to you!"}

Snug, comfortable and yet not squishy. It is a very well thoughtout bag: there is a strong velcrose component fabric floor that you could use as a floor hammock to allow the camcorder to sit on top: shock absorption.  There are a front pocket that I would place extra memory card (for those camcorders that do not have a built in hard drive) or loose change for those who have a built-in harddrive!  There are further side pockets, which really does not hold anything with mass. Also comes with a shoulder strap.  Neat and compact design.

For the lens to work the camera needs to be in the 'macro mode' (flower icon) with zoom fully out or pictures will be blurry. Works for wider angle shots as one would assume but can only be placed as close up as 5&#34; (perhaps a bit less) from a subject as well. Have only used it a few times as bought it mainly for Sunrise and Sunset and Storm photos but haven't had much chance to get any since purchasing the camera as weather has not been conducive for colorful sunrises and sets nor have there been any photogenic storms. The pictures that did come out were sharp though and having purchased this used it was worth getting."}
{"rating":2.0,"title":"Keys take effort to press and it needs to be propped up at an angle for effective typing by a touch typist","text":"I paired and typed with this keyboard on the following four devices:<br \/><br \/>1. iPad3<br \/>2. iPhone5<br \/>3. BLU Life One 4G LTE Smartphone - GSM Unlocked<br \/>4. Nexus 7 3rd generation<br \/><br \/>It paired easily with the first two iOS (Apple) devices.  However, the first-time pairing with the Android devices (items 3 and 4) took a lot of trial and error. I spent about 20 minutes trying to get each Android device to recognize the keyboard. I wound up charging the keyboard thinking it lacked power but it had a sufficient charge. When charging the keyboard did not help the situation, I turned the keyboard on and off, turned Bluetooth on and off, kept trying the pairing button with each attempt, etc., etc. Eventually, it finally worked but not without a lot of frustration. Also, with one of my devices, it paired using the MAC address of the keyboard and not the name.<br \/><br \/>In order to pair a Bluetooth device, one has to:<br \/>- Turn on the keyboard. Note that keyboard light will flash blue but only for a few seconds and it\u2019s hard to see it. (Sometimes it did not flash for me, instead it was a steady blue).<br \/>- Enable Bluetooth on the device you are pairing it with. The device must be no more than 32 feet from keyboard.<br \/>- Press and hold \u201cpair device\u201d button on keyboard for about 5 seconds--LED light starts flashing on keyboard.<br \/>- When the \u201cBluetooth Wireless Keyboard\u201d is found on your device, select it to complete the pairing process.<br \/>- To maximize keyboard functionality, once paired press FN + S for an iOS device and FN + A for an Android device. It\u2019s at this point that the keyboard is ready to use.<br \/><br \/>There are multi-function hot keys like Shift + ~ to return to the Home Page or Shift + ! to begin a Search using the default browser on the paired device.  However, the best use of the keyboard is for straight typing, in my opinion.<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/><br \/>- I like the feel of the keyboard. It\u2019s pliable, folds easily, and does not slip out of my hands.<br \/><br \/>- A micro-USB charging cable is supplied for charging the keyboard.<br \/><br \/>- Supposedly, this is waterproof. However, I did not dare submerge it in water. I will take their word for it.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/><br \/>- This keyboard is not designed for a touch typist like me. For instance, the QWERTY keyboard layout is a bit off because the B key is located on the right-hand side of the fold. I use my left hand to hit the B key but with this keyboard, I either have to over stretch my index finger to reach the B key or use my right hand.<br \/><br \/>- There are no risers for the keyboard; instead it lies very flat. In order for me to effectively type on this, I have to prop the top end on a book so that the keyboard lays on a slant.<br \/><br \/>- The keys are not sensitive to the touch, so I have to press hard in order for the letters to type.<br \/><br \/>- It\u2019s difficult to determine when the keyboard is powered on. Many times I had to press and hold the power button until the light flashed as a simple press of the button would not work. The instructions say the blue light flashes for three seconds when on but this did not always happen for me. Sometimes the blue light came on steady indicating the keyboard was on.  It was not always consistent.  I wound up either pressing the pairing button to see if the pairing light would flash or just tried typing when paired with a device. Depending on whether the keyboard worked or not, I knew whether it was on or not.<br \/><br \/>On another note, when I registered this keyboard on the VisionTek site, I got a confirmation email with my username and password in clear text. This is poor security as passwords should not be sent in clear text over the Internet.<br \/><br \/>In summary, had I tried out this keyboard in a store, I would have never selected it. Unless I am typing a lot with my Nexus 7, this is just too difficult to use due to the effort that has to be used to type, the flatness of the keyboard, and the slightly odd layout. I love the feel of the keyboard and its compactness but other than this, I\u2019m disappointed."}

The quality of the camera was good, but the spotlight was very annoying (depending on the amount of light in your house, it can be more than a tad overzealous). After speaking with Ring, I am now using a stick-up camera, and it is working much better indoors. I would recommend going that route instead if considering this for indoor use.<br \/><br \/>A couple of other things to note are battery life and subscription. To put it bluntly, the battery life on the spotlight camera is not good. Ring has a solar panel option that offsets this, so I would recommend getting that instead of the standard battery model. With one battery, I couldn't get more than a few weeks out of a full charge (possibly related to the aforementioned issues with an overzealous spotlight). Additionally, you do need a subscription to save any video with these cameras. They only save video to the cloud, so to get the full use of your camera you need to pay $3\/month for one device, or $10\/month for multiple devices.<br \/><br \/>I will also say that Ring's customer service is very good. They made sure I had the correct device for my particular situation, and have been very accommodating."}

The subscription is over priced for access to basic things they call advanced, like sleeping heart rate. Sleep score appears to be a lure for an expensive subscription trap.

The FitBit software development team ignores user feedback, almost all recent reviews are negative due to their recent changes. Watch bluetooth connection is unreliable.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Going Strong in our home since 2008","text":"Great for gift giving and receiving - affordable and easy to use. Currently I have a 2GB disk with 120 file folders and 2300 pictures running. The picture display is 6 inches by 3.5 inches.<br \/><br \/>My only real issue is that the user manual says I should be able to View pictures by date or filename. By default, the pictures on your frame are arranged and played by date, starting with the oldest. You can change the arrangement order, by date, or alphabetically by filename. To change the sort order: Frames-display thumbnails (see Viewing thumbnails), then tap  (Slide show options). Highlight Sort, then tap Select. Select a sort order, as follows.<br \/>Filename, A - Z<br \/>Filename, Z - A<br \/>Date, oldest to newest (default)<br \/>Date, newest to oldest<br \/><br \/>Then tap OK or Save. Except this option isn't doesn't exist - you can either select newest or oldest but not an alpha sort..<br \/><br \/>The picture quality isn't fabulous - none of the pictures pop out at you as they do on your smart phone or monitor or tablet or laptop. But  for what it isit is just fine we have 3 running in our house, Kitchen, Livingroom and family room. After each vacation I reload a disk.<br \/><br \/>The way cool thing is that you can set it to turn on like an alarm clock and go off when you want - ours runs 10am to 10pm. Running at night lights up the house so you don't want it running when you are sleeping.<br \/><br \/>Make sure to use the folder option. If you don't you will be limited to about 120 pictures."}

However, it just is not sturdy enough for me. The lip on the laptop tray is not big enough so my laptop just slides right on off especially lying in bed. The legs are so annoying!! I spend more time adjusting and adjusting and adjusting to make sure both sides are lined up symmetrically and in the right position so that I'm comfortable and my laptop is stable. I dont have time for that when I need to be studying. I have barely used this since I got it and probably will just sell it and find something else to be honest."}

CONS:  Slightly heavier and bigger than some emergency radios; sound quality of AM radio is not that good, although FM sounds decent.  Does not have regular battery backup (only uses an L-Ion battery, but it can be replaced if the battery goes bad.)<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is a decent little emergency radio with similar features to other emergency radios."}

It's sleek","text":"There are plenty of reviews here that will give you all the technical merits (and deficiencies, if any) of this laptop, but frankly, I'm going to just review this as a Plain Jane user. This laptop is awesome. It's sleek, not too heavy (though a bit large), and the battery life has been just fine for my needs. The screen resolution and quality is marvelous, and I appreciate that it's large enough to have a 10-number pad on the right (something I didn't realize I missed in my old laptop). The back-lit keyboard has come in handy more than once - another feature I didn't think much about, but love now that I have it. I also love, love, love how quickly this computer starts. Seriously, it's like a snap of the fingers, and POOF!, you're up and running. Hallelujah! Here's one thing I *will* say - touch screen is basically zero use to me without it converting to a tablet (like my Lenovo Twist). I always skip straight to the desktop of Windows 8, so never use the &#34;apps&#34; on the Start screen, and cannot conceive of many situations when touch screen is either helpful or necessary. Also, the mouse pad is sometimes a hit-and-miss to manage. Still, I adore this laptop."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A Well Designed, Useful Gadget for the Bag","text":"I had never used a lens pen before so I did a little research on you tube and I'm not sure how I got along without one.  It's one of those things you don't need every day, but when you do need it, it is wonderful to have.  The pen shaped design makes it ultimately portable and fits into any camera bag or vest.  The retractable brush is fantastic and the part that I thought I would use the most.  It did everything I hoped for in removing dust from optics.<br \/><br \/>What surprised me, due to ignorance is the fiber pads opposite of the brush.  I had not used it, and initially was pretty leery of it.  The reversible pad stem with the round and triangular pads are fantastic.  Like I said I was leery, so initially I only used it to clean the viewfinder on my dslr's and my binoculars.  The triangular pad easily got years of gunk out of the tightest corners of the viewfinder and the circular pad works great on the bins.<br \/><br \/>It took a video to fully understand that there was carbon in the pen cap and that you twist it to reprime the pads and clean them.  If I had one bit of constructive criticism it would be lack of even the barest instructions in the box.  Turned out there was more than met the eye for me. Also, a little overpackaged for something the size of a pen.<br \/><br \/>But, all in all, this is a great, solid, functional tool.  I really don't know why I didn't get one years ago."}

I always like to use wired network connections whenever possible. The ethernet cable is ridiculously close to the arc hdmi cable. And it was challenging to get the arc hdmi cable plugged in all the way. The instructions aren\u2019t the best, found out for arc audio it need to be in TV input. But it works fine with my Samsung TV and remote.<br \/>The sound is good for TV and Music but isn\u2019t going to fill you house with music, but fine for one room. The app works well on my iPhone and gives me plenty of options. I can also use the Alexa app to play music with other streaming services iHeart Radio etc. The on board Alexa app has some bugs that need to be worked out and I don\u2019t think you can connect\/group speakers at this point.

Not sure why some people have less than stellar reviews on this as I have had nothing but positive things to say since I started using it several months back.

I tend to leave the mouse and keyboard on 24x7 most of the time (I forget to shut them off) and I have yet to have to change batteries since first setting it up. If there were any downside at all, it would be that I honestly wish more vendors would make these keyboards with lit backgrounds (so it is easier to see the keys in poorly lit\/morning hours)."}

Reinserted discs..tried all different play modes to no avail. Then unplugged the unit from the wall and replugged and it started working again. That was fine for two days - then started using tuner again for a few days. Then went back to CD player and it was doing the same things again only now it won't work no matter what I do.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good for the price w\/great online performance","text":"I got this as a bedroom set to replace an old Hitachi 20\" CRT.  The picture is very good -- not always as good as my Samsung LN40C650 but it also required a lot less tweaking than the Samsung did.  It has the usual problems you would expect from any LCD -- including off-center viewing problems, backlight bleedthrough and flashlighting, and fast motion pixelization.  But for just 329 (+ tax from Sony direct) I can't complain.  The wireless internet access is the key feature that sold me, and it works fine.<br \/><br \/>PROS:  Wireless internet works well w\/Netflix, Pandora, Youtube, etc. and was easy to set up (using a wireless-G router two rooms away and no problems); very diverse selection of online content (more than Samsung); 720p is no problem; sound is very good; doesn't get hot; energy efficient; no dead or stuck pixels; no noise or buzz; very good HD and SD picture quality which did not require a ton of calibration out of the box -- just set it to Theater mode and it works.<br \/><br \/>CONS:  Usual LCD problems (as mentioned above) but not worse than any other LCD; base doesn't swivel; remote is kind of clunky to use and doesn't light up; only one USB port and that's occupied by the wireless internet device; not a lot of picture controls compared to the Samsung; not great when there's lots of motion on screen (only having a 60hz refresh rate doesn't help); the black plastic frame around the screen is very soft and scratches easily.<br \/><br \/>Overall I'm satisfied.  It does what I need it to do and for not a lot of money, and some channels look better than my Samsung that cost more than twice as much.  Those people complaining that it's slow to start up have to remember that any device using wi-fi takes a few seconds to start up and connect to the network."}

I would have preferred something with Windows Seven instead of Eight, but they were few and far between, and my wife doesn't seem to be having any problems getting around in the new OS.  Good value for someone not heavily into gaming or other resource hogging applications."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Decent for the Price!","text":"My teenagers go through a lot of ear buds. I ordered these because they are a name brand and was tired of having to replace the no-brand ones so frequently. My 17 year old son is very happy with them. My 14 year old daughter found them to be too large for her ears. They are basic ear buds. As far as my son is concerned, the sound is fine. He's not particularly picky. My husband used them the other day when he couldn't find his earphones and found the sound quality to be just average. So far, they are holding up well. If you're looking for great quality earbuds, these may not be what you're looking for, but if you're just looking for something cheap that is going to last a little longer than what you get at the discount store, then this is a great option."}

My experience with AmazonBasics products is that they generally perform reliably.<br \/><br \/>However, once I set this disc-shaped hub up, I realized that the port placement (at intervals around a flat disc) causes the USB cables for connected devices to take off in all directions, so that cable management in my computer area becomes difficult.

Presumably that's because the Amazon plug doesn't need a separate skill to work it, as the WEMO plugs do.  Because I use smart plugs to control room lights connected to hard-to-access outlets, it was a major annoyance when any one of my WEMO plugs would stop responding to Alexa and have to be unplugged and reset to get it working again.  (In WEMO's defense, I think this was happening to the WEMO plugs because Comcast reboots my system every night as part of its routine maintenance.)<br \/><br \/>Note that the Amazon Smart Plugs work only with Alexa.  I never used my WEMO switches for anything other than turning lights on and off at home with Alexa or the WEMO app, so I don't miss WEMO's remote connectivity features."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Simply in LOVE","text":"My first kindle was the Kindle Keyboard and I only used it as a pure reading device: no text to speech, no browser, very little highlighting to dictionary search (latter two options were not thatneasynon the keyboard) and unlike K1 and K2 reviews my key board did not wear out as I rarely used it other than create collection.<br \/><br \/>Now, after playing with my new 3G-WiFi. With ads - I am simply in love with this pure reading device.  It is everything I wanted and here is why I am in love:<br \/>1. The touch aspect to create new collection folders was so easy and then moving the books into them was intuitively easy (much easier than the KK,which was frustratingly slow);<br \/>2. Set up was real easy as the step by step guide was really helpful;<br \/>3. Moving some of my previously purchased books from the cloud to the new kindle was so easy, simple tap multiple books and when you switch back to the home page, they were downloaded really fast!  Wow.  I was worried this transfer was going to be a painful process, woohoo - so not the case.<br \/>4. Light adjustment was easy and reading in a dark room was easy and no eye strain!!! Super whoop whoop. (update: I am in double of getting sleepless nights! The reading in the dark was sooo comfortable, and I couldn't stop reading!  Wow.  Love it).<br \/>5. The touch screen was so easy to use and very intuitive and I do like the fonts selection!<br \/>6. Now has a little clock on top right wephen you are on the home page so I can check when to start cooking dinner!<br \/>7. There is finally a password (numbers only) at last to protect access to your kindle!!!<br \/>8. Great size and easy to hold in one hand and easy to touch and move the page, which was nice and responsive.<br \/>9. Shop kindle is the same as is the location of the ads, which I do not find intrusive as it only appears when your screen is asleep and not when you are reading!  Had no issue with it with my KK, and no issue with the ads now!<br \/>10. I upgraded to the 3G- i had to goto the lobby that would prompt the 3G- nice!!! My KK only had wifi.<br \/>11. Extra pixel, you certainly notice it against the KK! But your brain and yes adjust very quickly so it may seem like nothing, but relatively, the improvement is noticeable!<br \/><br \/>Yes, I understand why some people are not happy with the light projection, as there are four lights projected from the bottom of the screen, which does create a little teeny weeny shadow.  It is not so annoying at all, not for me and it Does not interrupt the reading experience since the wee shadow do not affect the text.  Just my experience.<br \/><br \/>All round for me, this kindle is everything I want in a kindle!  I am soooooooo happy and yes, the upgrade, for me, from a KK was worth it.  I am in love!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Delivers Adequate Power to Charge Four Devices; Features Small Tabletop Footprint","text":"What I really like about the CHIL POWERSHARE 5.1 AMP REACTOR is the small tabletop footprint.  This charging station consists of a white 4-port USB charger (reactor) inserted into a black silicone stand (tower).  The silicone is stiff enough to support the charger, but still flexible enough to allow removal of the charger if you don't want the stand.  However, the tower stand is what makes this charging station fit so conveniently into a small space.  And because the stand holds the charger with the ports facing up, the charger ports are highly accessible and it's fairly easy to coil and manage the USB cables that are plugged into the ports (and into your mobile devices).<br \/><br \/>The charger has three 1.0 amp ports (each suitable for charging power banks, Kindles, small tablets, and smartphones), and one 2.1 amp port (suitable for charging iPads, iPods, and large tablets).  Thus the ports deliver a total of 5.1 amps.  These particular four ports are adequate to keep all of my family's daily-use mobile devices charged, because we rarely need to charge two devices that require 2.1 amps at the same time.<br \/><br \/>To test this Chil Powershare Reactor, I plugged in an iPad (2.1 amp), a Kindle Paperwhite (1.0 amp), a Motorola Droid Razr smartphone (1.0 amp), and a Qi wireless charging pad (1.0 amp).<br \/><br \/>---My devices to be charged began with varying amounts of charge:  iPad (77%); Kindle Paperwhite (nearly empty); Motorola smartphone (86%); and Qi-enabled Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone (45%).<br \/><br \/>---After 55 minutes, the charges had increased:  iPad (97%); Kindle Paperwhite (about 50%); Motorola smartphone (100%); Samsung smartphone (82%).  This was much better than I expected; definitely as good as or better than other charging stations that I've used.  Qi wireless charging is generally slower than direct charging, so the Samsung smartphone was charging as expected.  At this point I unplugged the iPad and the Motorola smartphone, as both were almost completely charged.<br \/><br \/>---After 85 minutes, the remaining two devices had added to their charge:  Kindle Paperwhite (about 75%); Samsung Qi-enabled smartphone (95%).<br \/><br \/>I'm completely satisfied with these results.  Any 1.0 amp port and a Kindle USB cable will charge any of my Kindles (Fire 8.9\" tablet, Keyboard, Paperwhite); any 1.0 amp port will power my Qi-charging pad for the Samsung smartphone and other devices; and any 1.0 amp port plus an appropriate cable will charge my power banks and Motorola smartphone.  The charging occurs rapidly enough for my needs.<br \/><br \/>If you're concerned, as I once was, about  plugging an older USB device into a USB port that delivers more power than the device really needs, you needn't worry.  The device will NOT blow up--what's likely to happen is that the device will charge a little faster, although some older USB devices won't charge at all.  (For a clear explanation of this, look online for the enlightening ExtremeTech article, \"How USB Charging Works, or How to Avoid Blowing Up Your Smartphone\".)<br \/><br \/>The Chil Powershare Reactor has an ordinary wall-outlet plug (no extra grounding prong--just two prongs, one wide, one narrow).  It has a moderately short power cord (about 45\"), but the cord can be coiled inside the silicone tower or around the reactor for portability and \"cable management\".<br \/><br \/>The packaging materials state that this charger \"limits 'vampire drain' when inactive\", but give no further details about this presumably energy-saving feature.  The charger does NOT have an on\/off switch, so it's always on when plugged in."}

BUT it once you get it there, it stays exactly where you place it.<br \/>CONS<br \/>- the clamp is really really stiff and difficult to stretch enough to hold your phone or device.  If you have any strength issues, this might not be the best choice.  Also, they edges will pinch you if you accidentally get your fingers in the way of the spring loaded clips.<br \/>- The table clamp only works with tables that are flat on top and bottom.  The place I wanted to clamp on has a groove underneath and my husband had to make a wooden block of sorts for the table clamp to work.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I like the stand - but the engineering that is required to make a strong, stable holder, also makes it difficult to use.

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Poor player, don't waste the money on this model","text":"This blu-ray player (Sharp Aquos BD-HP22U) is extremely slow to respond to anything. Do not make the mistake of turning it off with a disc in it. It takes a good 3-5 minutes to turn on unless you leave it on standby (solid red light). If you leave a disc in the player, turning it on will stretch into 5 minutes or more while it also needs to load a disc inside. When it first recognizes power (as in unplugging it to save a little $), the power light continually blinks red for several minutes apparently thinking about the access of electricity, before you can push power to turn it on. If you attempt to insist it turn on or open the tray, it just makes the process take even longer. Once power has been accessed and you first put in a new disc, it loads in a reasonable period of time, but slowly. We had it for two weeks before it asked for a software\/firmware update and refused to play blu-ray discs, but this particular model HP22U actually does NOT even exist according to Sharp's website and so far, no update has been possible. After several months of continuing to use it just for DVD, it has begun to skip on DVDs, even brand new ones, and will not play others. This item is NOT RECOMMENDED"}

They were so in love that the day after Christmas, I purchased one too and am really enjoying it.  You really can't go wrong when it comes to Apple."}

I was even more impressed with the build quality. There was little to no keyboard flex at all, and the casing is actually made of what looks like a brushed aluminum. Keystroke is surprisingly long for how thin the keyboard is, but has good feel. I only would not recommend this for gaming because of its size. However, it's size does bring it extreme portability.

The hinges feel very solid and the display will rotate any direction you turn it.<br \/><br \/>It's way more than fast enough for home and work. The SSD is great. The Intel graphics don't seem to lag and you can even run games with decent framerates. The speakers are good enough. The screen can get reflective if there's a lot of light behind you. The battery says it last 7 hours though with full screen streaming video it lasts three. There's a sliding shutter over the camera. There's not a lot of bloatware, just a few apps that are easy to delete."}

It took a while for me to figure out how to turn down the volume (you need to push and HOLD the volume button when it is NOT alarming until it drops - but if you hold it down too long it goes up again. This is NOT explained in the instruction booklet)... but once I figured that out, it 's more pleasant. In my car, in order to give it a full view front and back, it has to be placed near the review view mirror..

It also makes it harder for my kids to pull the earphones out of my ears when there is no long cord attached to my phone. I love the 1 click pause feature so i can quickly pause what i am listening to talk to someone (i don't have to go find my phone and swipe and pause). They are comfortable and stay on really well for my ears. I have taken them running and they stayed on as well.

Usually when I travel, I'm lugging around a small wheeled overnight bag plus a bulky camera bag and tripod, but with the Convertible Rolling Camera Bag, I'm able to combine my camera and lenses and overnight bag into a single bag. The clever Velcro interior can be rearranged in any number of configurations; there is room for two camera bodies and numerous lenses, along with a built-in laptop pouch, memory cards, and ample side pockets. It also comes with a rain cover. You can use the bag as a roller bag (preferable) or as a backpack. The wheels handle smoothly and the collapsible handle is sturdy; I feel like this bag will stand up to a lot of abuse and still perform well. I look forward to stepping up my photography game (and saving my back!) with this great new addition from AmazonBasics!"}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Works perfectly","text":"This is advertised as an ergonomic keyboard.  To me, ergonomic is a keyboard that is split into two slanted halves, like the Microsoft Natural Keyboard.  This is a flat keyboard.  In spite of that, the keys have a good feel and response.  I only have wired keyboards, so I got this so that I could have a wireless if I wanted to use one sometimes, as you are then not confined with a cord.  Requires 1 AA battery to operate (not included).  At first, I thought they forgot to include the wireless transmitter, but it comes hidden in the battery compartment.  This is okay, but there is no place to store it once the battery is installed.  Of course, if you are going to store the keyboard and not use it all the time, you wouldn't typically want to leave the battery in anyway.  If you want wireless, probably better to get a wireless mouse and keyboard together, as they would probably run off one transmitter, whereas with this keyboard if I want to add a wireless mouse later, it will involve using a second transmitter which would use another USB port.  The keyboard is going to be of limited use to me, as I currently use a KVM-switch that allows me to control up to 4 computers with one monitor, one mouse and one keyboard.  I would have to upgrade to a KVM switch that takes USB to use the keyboard on more than one computer.  This is truly plug and play and I had it operating in no time at all.  Seems like it is quality made and should last a while.  Made in China of course."}

And while, yes, it works well with our MacBook Air, it also works just as well with our HP desktop computer. It will charge multiple devices through the hub and access multiple devices through the hub. For the MacBook Air, it gives additional USB spots, which is helpful. For our HP, which is an AIO computer, it gives much easier access to the USB ports. It does not come with the connector to plug this into the wall and make it, itself powered, but it will use the power from your computer to charge through it anyway. (You can buy the power cord.)<br \/>The only thing I'm not super happy about it the connection plug on the back.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"My first camera was a knockout!","text":"After spending around six months scouring various digital camera reviews online and through magazines, I finally decided on the Canon Powershot A95 5 Megapixel camera as offering the perfect marriage of power and portability.  My first digital camera, I bought it as a going-away present for myself, since I was spending the summer living and working in Spain and knew that I needed a camera that could keep up with my travels.<br \/><br \/>It was a snap to take out and set up, and intuitive enough that a couple of cursory glances at the Quick Start guide had me well on my way to pointing and shooting. The camera comes with a USB cable, several software programs, a 16 MB Compact Flash card (of course, you'll want to invest in more memory as soon as possible - with the highest-resolution photos, consider a 512 MB or larger card), batteries, and a wrist strap.<br \/><br \/>I would rate the camera as mid-sized. It is not wafer-thin, but neither is it absurdly bulky or heavy. For most of my traveling around Spain, I simply slipped it into its bubble wrap and into a soft fabric bag, where it fit comfortably in my purse.  The design is comfortable to shoot with over long periods, and I found the layout of the buttons to be intuitive.  Less is more: there are few external buttons (shutter, on\/off, menu and related buttons), and most controls are carried out through the on-screen menus.  The flip-out LCD screen is one reason I decided on this Canon over others in the PowerShot line; it makes previewing photos a snap, and can be swiveled 180 degrees.<br \/><br \/>The photo quality (I kept it on large superfine) is astonishing: clear, sharp, vibrant photos (check out some of my uploaded photos using the Canon A95) in true-to-life tones with minute detailing. There are various shooting modes, including manual, macro, panoramic (with Stitch Assist software), nighttime, slow shutter, and more, and a movie mode that captures brief (jerky) videos with tinny sound. This isn't a camcorder, so I wasn't surprised that video quality wasn't better, since I bought this primarily for photos.<br \/><br \/>You will also want to invest in a few basic accessories: rechargeable NiCad batteries and a rapid charger, a sturdy case, and a bigger memory card, for starters. Although the included software is capable enough to get the job done, consider upgrading to Adobe Photoshop Elements (around $90), or if you're a pro, Adobe PhotoShop CS 2 (several hundred dollars). An excellent first camera with plenty of power and a reliable name."}

This was extremely helpful when one of my battery backups suddenly expired--taking down telephone and Internet service--and needed immediate replacement.  (There was NO need to open the UPS battery compartment and fiddle with the terminals before plugging the UPS in.)<br \/><br \/>To my surprise, the Liebert UPS has a liquid crystal display that shows the battery charge before the unit is plugged in (new out of the box, my battery was about 85% charged).  After the unit is plugged in, the LCD has &#34;icons and numerical information to display UPS status and operational parameters&#34; (e.g., input, output, total load).  There is a built-in input circuit breaker that trips if the output load exceeds the unit's power rating.<br \/><br \/>The UPS even has a button you can press to turn off the beeping during a power outage!  Because my area experiences frequent inexplicable outages (ranging from less than a minute to a few hours) this feature alone is enough to make me buy Lieberts from now on.<br \/><br \/>The outlets are conveniently placed on the unit.  There are four surge protection plus battery backup outlets (outlets that keep your computer and critical electronics operating on battery power for a few minutes into an outage), and four surge protection only outlets.  One of each type of outlet is placed slightly apart from the others, to make space for extra-large plugs.<br \/><br \/>I don't use the software that usually comes with a UPS, but this Liebert UPS includes a CD with documentation and optional software, a 6-1\/2 ft. coaxial cable (for TV), and a 3 ft. USB cable (for computer).  There are ports for telephone lines as well.<br \/><br \/>This is a beautifully designed UPS with all the expected features, and with some great unexpected features."}
{"rating":2.0,"title":"update-Jan 2022","text":"So these are not bad cameras or great ones.  They do seem to either miss important events or overcapture little ones like bugs flying past.  My biggest issue is that I now own two outdoor cameras that would work if they could be charged.  I use them with solar panels but after a few months I get a message that they need to be charged.  I thought maybe this was because we had some not sunny days but now I am realizing that the port that the usb cord plugs into gets broken.  I don't know if it is from wind or just cheap products but when I took each camera in to charge with the supplied cord from the box, the port sunk into the camera.  There is no way to get them out.  I tried to unscrew the camera to get it from the inside but the plastic seems to be welded on as even unscrewed I cannot open the camera.  I contacted the company when it happened the first time and they said there was nothing they could do about it as the warranty expired.  Then I asked them  how to open it up so I could try to push it out and they said just undo the screws.  When I told them that didn't work, they did not respond.<br \/><br \/>For the second camera - it is a replacement they sent me from yet a different issue on the original.  I have only had it up for 6 months and got the same message about needing it to charge.  I brought it in from the solar panel and as I plugged the cord into it, the port pushed all the way in again.  No way to access it.  REally bad design flaw.  I am waiting to hear back from the company but expect them to tell me it is out of warranty - even though it was a replacement given to me only 6 months ago, prior to the original camera's warranty expiration.<br \/><br \/>The support seem nice.  They only contact you through email so often takes 1-2 weeks to solve issues.  At one point they did call me because my work schedule just did not allow for an accurate solution via email.  The problem is the product has this major flaw when it comes to the quality of its ports for charging.  Wish I could get a recommendation for a camera that has better built materials.<br \/><br \/>So had to drop a star for this."}

Quality concept.. everything you need to charge condensed into one port! The perfect solution for mom who\u2019s expected to have those vital \u201cdevice life lines\u201d when these are forgotten and battery is low!<br \/><br \/>This pretty much covers all bases.. And a 2pk. for $15- is a steal! Great for kiddo off to college, spare for the glove box, work briefcase, stocking stuffer. *A grand idea for \u00dcber\/Lyft drivers- creates option for passengers to have courtesy charge as they ride. Ha.. driver will have the proper cord needed! Beyond ideal for hotel stay since outlets are always limited.. Multi cord is a problem solver!!<br \/><br \/>Construction: so far we\u2019ve used 3 of 4 connectors-each fit is snug and secure when connected- USB end into car port + outlet is solid as well, nothing is loose or slipping. Love weak points are reinforced with protective cover, keeps cord from dreaded \u201cend-bend!\u201d (see up close photos included.) Cord is a reinforced braided nylon but, still has bend ability.<br \/><br \/>Added perks: (like it need more!) cord length is 10ft. long.. Yay!! No need to huddle around outlet like it\u2019s life breath bc, cord is too short to take a step either way! Splitters are individually color coordinated to identify specific type just by cords color.. Double iPhone support! Being most popular device- cord has extra iPhone charger.. Lastly, it will rapid charge multiple devices at the same time.. Boom- mic drop..!!<br \/><br \/>Overall, Multi charging cable is a solution to many issues and inconveniences, I recommend without hesitation.. A total game changer! Hoping this helps your decision- stay safe everyone."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"DISPOSABLE card reader - simple to use but only worked once for my IBM Microdrive,","text":"****See revised update below under August 28, 2011 update and beyond****<br \/><br \/>I have a Canon PowerShot G3 camera that is not supported from a software \/ driver file perspective on the Windows Vista Operating System on my laptop. As a result I needed to buy a USB card reader to read my CompactFlash Card and IBM Microdrive.<br \/><br \/>This is how simple it was to use:<br \/><br \/>1) I opened the package it came in.<br \/><br \/>2) I plugged in the cable that came with it to the USB port on my laptop and the other end to the card reader. (Note that you don't have to attach the cable since you can plug the card reader directly into the USB port.  The only reason I used the cable is because I was using a USB mouse in the other port and the connection wasn't secure because the card reader is a hairline too thick to plug in with something else in the other USB slot.)<br \/><br \/>3) I then removed the 1GB IBM Microdrive I had in my camera (which is the same size as my CompactFlash Drive for the same camera) and inserted it into the largest slot in the reader FACE UP.<br \/><br \/>4) My system immediately installed the driver and I accessed the drive like I would any thumb drive or flash drive.<br \/><br \/>5) I then drilled down to the directories where the JPGs were stored and copied them over to my hard drive.<br \/><br \/>Access times were super fast.  It was as if I was accessing the photos on my internal hard drive.  This card reader is just wonderful.  There are 5 slots on the unit that can apparently read 50 different cards; although I can't vouch for that, I can vouch for my hassle free experience with the cards I'm using.  It could read both my 1 GB IBM Microdrive and my 32M CompactFlash Card.<br \/><br \/>August 28, 2011 Update - I've lowered my review to 1-star because it only worked once for my IBM microdrive.  I now have to order another card reader because the reason I purchased this was for my Microdrive.  I have lots of pictures on my 1GB drive that I cannot retrieve.  I looked at the pins and they are no longer even which means it's not making a connection.<br \/><br \/>Sept. 16, 2011 Update - After my card reader failed, I contacted Kodak support and got someone who had trouble speaking English and understanding me.  However, eventually he agreed the card reader was defective.  I shipped it back (at my cost) and a couple of weeks later I got a Vivitar Series 1 72-in-1 Hi-Speed Card Reader\/Writer. Well, it was very nice of them to ship me something I didn't expect but it doesn't work with the microdrive because the slot housing is too slim. If the housing didn't prevent the drive from being inserted, it should have worked.  However, it does fit my compactflash card because that housing is slimmer.<br \/><br \/>I decided to buy [[ASIN:B00109Y2DQ Kingston 19-in-1 USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader FCR-HS219\/1]] which works in the same slot for both drives."}

The bass comes across very clear as if you\u2019re in a room listening to a high-quality stereo.<br \/>The noise cancellation is the best that I\u2019ve experienced. You have the option of either blocking everything out or allowing some noise to come in so that you can be aware in your environment. To give you an idea of how good the noise cancellation is, I have driven with my window down and have been sitting by a couple of Harleys at a stop light, neither instance was too loud for this setting. However, when the Harleys accelerated, I definitely heard them but they were not overwhelmingly loud.<br \/><br \/>Like I mentioned in the title however, the only issue I have with them is they fall out easily no matter what size ear tip I use. So this caused another purchase for me to buy ear hooks to secure them in my ear.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"This unit is very large; CD speaker sound is fantastic; Bluetooth is adequate; overall a well-rounded system","text":"This unit is large and not at all like the dimensions listed on Amazon. It is 5 inches high (top to bottom), 8 inches deep (front to back), and 16 inches in long (side-to-side).<br \/><br \/>WHAT COMES IN THE BOX:<br \/>- one speaker unit with both left and right speakers inside the large housing<br \/>- one power cord<br \/>- one FM antenna cord \/ wire<br \/>- one AAA battery<br \/>- one remote<br \/>- three user guides; one in English, Spanish, and French (I love this because I can keep the instructions in English and throw out the others)<br \/>- one limited 1-year warranty insert<br \/><br \/>FEATURES:<br \/>- Bluetooth speaker<br \/>- CD player<br \/>- FM Radio with ability for 30 preset radio stations<br \/>- Ability to operate controls via remote or front of the unit buttons<br \/>- Clock<br \/>- Sleep \/ timer function up to 120 minutes in 15-minute increments<br \/>- LED Dimmer<br \/>- USB terminal that supports USB memory (thumb drive) in FAT 16 or FAT 32 format<br \/>- Line In port to plug in an external audio device such as earphones \/ headphones<br \/><br \/>The sound this produces when I play my CDs was awesome and music to my ears. I also paired this speaker with my Google Nexus 7 Tablet (2013 version Android device) and my iPad Pro 12.9 and experienced moderately powerful sound there as well. The FM radio was staticky but that was due to the location of where I placed my unit. When I did receive a station, the sound was great.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this produces beautiful sound. As a Bluetooth speaker, it does not produce as powerful a sound as my [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Block Rocker]] but it is still good. The addition of the FM radio is a nice touch. I also like that it functions as an LED clock. The instructions and operation of the unit take a bit of getting use to and can be confusing but I was eventually able to figure it out; although I may have to consult the pamphlet every now and then. Overall, this is a well-rounded unit for indoor use but the unit is larger than I expected. It is as large as those old AM\/FM amplifiers from years ago and has a retro  70\u2019s look (see attached picture).<br \/><br \/>PS For those who are interested in comparisons, this is my sixth Bluetooth speaker. I ordered five other Bluetooth speakers over a several year period.  I have a [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]], which is not very good and a [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] which does not work when paired with some devices and, when it does pair well, it usually lacks the powerful sound I am looking for.<br \/><br \/>I also purchased one [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Audio Block Rocker (iPA76A) | Portable Bluetooth Speaker]] and one [[ASIN:B01N17AQ7U ION Audio IPA88 Tailgater Flash Wireless\/Bluetooth Speaker]] both from Costco. I absolutely love the Block Rocker (except for when paired with my iPad Pro) and I only like the Tailgate Flash. The lights on the Tailgate Flash annoy me because they have to be turned off every time I power on the unit. Nevertheless, the sound from the ION speakers are usually awesome. The IONs are the only ones I use frequently indoors (even though they are more of an outdoor Bluetooth speaker). They are battery powered powerful speakers and the sound is intense.  If one wants Bluetooth only with the capability of travelling with them without having to find a power outlet, then these are worth considering.<br \/><br \/>I also have a [[ASIN:B01MUG5WIN Sony XB20 Portable Wireless Speaker with Bluetooth, Blue (2017 model)]] which pairs well with my HP Omen Laptop and moderately well with my Nexus 7 and iPad Pro. However, this has to be charged first just like the Goal Zero speaker that I dislike.<br \/><br \/>PS My boyfriend connected his iPad 3 to this one's Bluetooth and loves it for listening to Podcasts. In order to get the volume as loud as he wanted, he also used the volume controls on the side of his iPad in conjunction with the volume knob on the Toshiba. On another note, he mentioned that the controls located below the CD player are very small for someone who has eye problems and I would agree with that. What I find inconvenient is that the button to open and close the CD player is there so that when the CD is open, I have to put my hand underneath it to close if I am not using the remote. Nevertheless, he loves this Toshiba just like I do."}

The quality of prints is okay, but not as good as what she gets with her Fuji Instax Mini 8 camera. The pictures are printed on sticker paper so she's had fun with that. It prints a little key on the photo so you can scan and access the video, but the key is small and doesn't detract too much from the image. You have to download the app in order to view the video. You do not have to record the video when you are taking your picture - you can use a video you already have if you want.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Sleek, stylish, and incredible sound!","text":"My first Bluetooth speaker was the Bose Soundlink; I then transitioned to a smaller, more portable Braven LUX. As an audiophile, when I was offered the opportunity to test drive the RIVA Turbo X, I jumped at it. The first thing I noticed right off the bat is the WEIGHT; the speaker clocks in at nearly 6 pounds (compared to the lightweight Braven, or the slightly heftier Soundlink). It's also designed like a sportscar, with a glossy black finish with red rubber accents covering access ports. The top contains streamlined buttons for Power, Surround, Bluetooth pairing, mute, up and down volume, and Turbo mode. There's also an iOS app that allows you to control the surround and turbo settings directly from your phone.<br \/><br \/>I appreciated the quick start guide handily attached to the top of the speaker; it recommends that you play the speaker at 50% volume for several hours to break them in. It comes out of the box partially charged (around 40%) meaning you can start using it immediately (which I did using David Garret's new &#34;Explosive&#34; album). The sound balance is fantastic; as I live in an apartment, unfortunately I'm not able to really take advantage of the Turbo mode (which boosts to over 100dB). Pairing was a snap and I was off and running. As soon as I synched with my iPad, I was prompted to download the &#34;Ground Control&#34; app (which as previously mentioned, gives you battery life stats, volume, and the ability to turn on surround and Turbo modes).<br \/><br \/>It also comes loaded with extras in the form of RCA cables, male-to-male audio cables, and it's also capable of charging other devices. The battery is recharged via AC (the life is around 26 hours); no USB option here. The touch buttons on top illuminate when you hold your hand over it, which is a fantastic feature in a dark room or if you're using this outside.<br \/><br \/>The sound is fantastic with just about every genre I threw at it, from Baroque opera vocals to instrumentals to EDM.<br \/><br \/>This is a serious investment that not only looks fantastic, but sounds absolutely fantastic...and my Bose Soundlink is going in the closet. If you're looking for maximum power with no trade in sound quality (especially at higher volume levels), the Riva TurboX is the way to go."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great Picture; Lots of available adjustments; low blue light emissions; auto adjustment to light levels","text":"Maybe it is just because I haven't upgraded my monitor in a long time and maybe it is because this is the biggest monitor I have ever had on a computer, but I love this monitor.  Since I spend a lot of time on the computer, this has a feature that is very important to me, which is low blue light emissions.  The blue light that comes from monitors is not good for our eyes, so a monitor that claims to reduce that is a good thing, if it really works.  I don't know how to tell for sure, but after using the monitor for several days, it does seem that I suffer less eye fatigue.  The monitor also has a &#34;bright intelligence&#34; button that automatically dims or brightens the screen depending on light levels, which helps reduce eye fatigue.  This feature can be turned on or off to your preference.  There a number of different light adjustments on the monitor and they are not difficult to select, once you figure out the buttons to set them.  There are 5 adjustment buttons, but none are assigned to a specific function, but there is a way to assign some of the buttons, so they are configurable to some extent.  Initially, you press any one of the buttons to bring up a five selection menu on screen that allows you to adjust brightness, depending on what you are doing (web surfing, multimedia, office or reading) as well contrast and sharpness.  There are various other display adjustments for positioning the screen (which I had to use, since the screen was initially slightly off center at the highest resolution).  Also there are adjustments buttons for sound, if you use the built-in speakers and for auto shutoff time (choice of OFF, 10, 20 and 30 minutes).  There are various other settings.  I don't quite understand all the settings, but there is an included manual on the CD that comes with the monitor and the manual seems very complete, is well written and easy to understand.  My monitor also included an HDMI cable.  I tried using HDMI, but couldn't see much difference in that and the older type of connector (which they call D-Sub, also known as VGA, which is an analog connection vs. digital).  If you are watching Blu-Ray movies, HDMI should give you a better picture.  I don't have any Blu-Ray movies, nor a DVD drive that supports Blu-Ray, so no need for HDMI.  Also, I use a KVM switch to control several computers and that doesn't support HDMI connectors.  The included CD also has any drivers you might need, but the monitor worked perfectly on Windows 10 without the need to install any drivers.  The HDMI connection did bring sound to the built-in speakers, as well as the picture, but the sound volume was extremely low, even at 100%.  When I used the other connector (D-Sub), and a separate audio cable, the sound volume was much better.  Maybe something I am setting incorrectly?  Also, typical of speakers built-in to a monitor, the sound quality is very poor.  If you listen to music much at all, you will want to stick with external speakers.  This is probably typical of all monitors with built-in speakers.  It was disappointing, but not unexpected.  The monitor is very lightweight, so it is very easy to move.  Has a nice low profile base.  Can be tipped to a desirable viewing angle, but no height adjustment.  There is a lot to this monitor and to take full advantage of it, I will need to read the manual to understand all the available settings.  Requires a 2 step assembly of the base, but it is very easy; you should be up and running in mere minutes.  This can be wall mounted, but requires a separate wall mount kit, which is not included.  Overall, a great monitor that should meet the needs of just about anyone.  With a 3-year warranty, you can't go wrong."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Can't take photos + no screen = not good","text":"This is my first GoPro and I'm underwhelmed.<br \/><br \/>Starting with the good: The camera inside is great for video. It can record at 5.3K resolution @ 60 FPS, 4K @ 120 FPS, or 2.7K @ 240 FPS. The video quality is really good. Crispy and clear. Love it.<br \/><br \/>Now the bad: first off, this thing CANNOT shoot still photos (??), which is absurd. If you want a photo, you'll have to record a video and take a screengrab. No idea why they didn't include a photo feature.<br \/><br \/>The second-worst thing is that there is no screen, front or back. While I obviously knew this going in, not having any preview display has been a bigger annoyance than expected.  It feels like this is being marketed as a more rugged version of the Hero 11 Black, but I'd rather just throw a case on a Hero 11 vs. not having a screen.<br \/><br \/>A couple other missing features, it doesn't have any scheduled capture mode or GPS. Neither of those are important to me, but I figure I'd mention them.<br \/><br \/>There is a flip-out cover that has a USB-C port and an SD card slot. It does not support an external microphone (!) and does not have an HDMI out. It's possible it'll support the GoPro external mic in the future after a firmware update, but TBD.<br \/><br \/>The battery is not removable, which I think they did to save (physical) size on the device. The battery is billed to give 60 minutes of recording time at max resolution, which feels about right given my experience. Lower resolution or FPS will allow for longer battery life.<br \/><br \/>I'd pass on this. Too many missing features to justify a purchase."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Fuzzy images.  Not a good choice for a first telescope.","text":"This isn't a good first telescope, if the intent is to introduce and encourage someone to pursue the hobby of astronomy further.  The images were fuzzy and distorted and varied in focus across the field of view.  Any reflector telescope, even this small one, requires the mirrors to be precisely aligned (collimated) to get sharp images.  Out of the box, the two mirrors were not aligned well.  I did take it apart.  I unscrewed the primary mirror holder from the bottom and drilled out larger diameter holes so that I could adjust the positioning of primary mirror  I reseated the secondary mirror (below the eyepiece) which was not level.  The 3 existing screws in the secondary mirror can be adjusted to adjust the alignment of the secondary mirror.  After some manual collimation, the image is now much better.  Stars no longer look like fuzzy balls.  But this process isn't easily done in this telescope, nor is it described in the included instructions.  Reflector telescopes can be quite persnickety because of their need to be precisely adjusted.  My advice is to either spend more money on an reflector which has better optics which can be collimated, or choose a refractor telescope which I think is easier to use for a beginner and doesn't require such adjustments such as this one for not much higher cost:<br \/>Celestron 21035 70mm Travel Scope https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B001TI9Y2M\/ref=cm_sw_r_other_taa_QTn5zbPV2FBNX"}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Dynamic \"Quality of Service\" Feature Helps Out Home Network With Many Attached Devices","text":"I'm not a gamer, but I do have around 30 devices connected to a home network.  These include WEMO switches, Amazon Echos, a smart TV, a playstation, Kindles, iPads, printers, and smartphones.  The &#34;dynamic Quality of Service&#34; feature of this NIGHTHAWK X4 ULTIMATE GAMING ROUTER (R7500v2) seems to prioritize these devices, so that all of them are more responsive (faster connections) than they were with my previous router (a rock-solid NIGHTHAWK (R7000)).<br \/><br \/>When this NIGHTHAWK (R7500v2) is set up, it recognizes all of the &#34;Internet of things&#34; devices for what they are.  In the &#34;attached devices&#34; list, these aren't given device names (e.g., &#34;iPad&#34;, picked up from the device itself) but have &#34;n\/a&#34; in the name column (and you can't assign them names even if you know them by the MAC numbers).  I don't know exactly how the &#34;Quality of Service&#34; feature performs its magic, but now when I ask an Amazon Echo to turn on a light or a fan, the Echo performs the task immediately--instead of with a delay while it searched through the router's list of connected devices for the correct one.<br \/><br \/>The PCs and other devices that use lots of bandwidth (instead of being on standby much of the time) seem to connect faster, and they test (using OOKLA) at significantly faster Internet speeds.<br \/><br \/>My R7500v2 is broadcasting signals for both bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz), and my compatible devices connect with the 5 GHz network whenever I ask them to.  However, I don't use the 5 GHz band for anything at present (because it's easiest to have everything that uses a printer on the same band with the printers).  Thus I don't know whether the router frequently drops the 5 GHz signal, as other reviewers have stated.<br \/><br \/>I've used several high-end Linksys routers, and they have performed very well.  However, I find that Netgear routers lose their Internet signal far less often, and almost never require rebooting--when Netgear routers need rebooting, the issue is almost always traceable to Comcast problems.<br \/><br \/>Another reason that I prefer Netgear routers over Linksys routers is that Netgear has no limit (or a very high limit) on the number of devices that you can list by MAC number and tell the router to &#34;allow only these devices to connect to the network&#34;.  I use this feature as an extra firewall, and find that the Linksys 25-device list is inadequate for my needs.<br \/><br \/>Finally, the Netgear &#34;Genie&#34; app for managing the router settings is clear and easy to understand.  The initial setup for this router is easy, unless you have a nonstandard home network (e.g., my router is connected with the Comcast-supplied equipment in &#34;Bridge&#34; mode), and\/or you interrupt the setup routine before it's run through all its steps.  If you do land in setup limbo, you can start over by resetting the router to the factory settings (use a paperclip to hold down the reset button for 10-30 seconds--light will blink; unplug from wall for 30 seconds; follow Quick Start instructions again from beginning)."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A Heftier, More \"Substantial\" Stylus","text":"Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This Targus stylus, which is 4.75\" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is quite a good one, in terms of sensitivity.  Screens slide with minimal pressure, and selections register with only a light touch or tap.<br \/><br \/>Compared to other styluses that I tested, the Targus stylus is the longest, has the widest barrel, and is the heaviest.  The weight makes it tiring for me to use, but some individuals (men, perhaps?) may prefer a heftier, more \"substantial\" stylus like this one.  Because of the wider barrel, the tip is also wider, which makes it slightly less accurate for selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts).  The extra length is a plus, if you hold a stylus like a pointer (away from the tip), rather than like a pencil (close to the tip).<br \/><br \/>This stylus has both a pocket clip and a metal attachment \"loop\" (for attaching to a lanyard or keychain).  I purchased mine at a local office supplies store.  Besides this stylus, I tested the [[ASIN:B005O2URES MiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen]], the [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]], and the [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]].  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4.25 \" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity.  I rate this stylus at 4 stars (\"I like it\") rather than 5 stars (\"I love it\"), because I like the AmazonBasics stylus slightly better.<br \/><br \/>In case you're wondering, as I was, what a \"capacitive\" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses \"capacitive sensing\" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.  Wikipedia has good articles on capacitive sensing and capacitive devices."}

First, the Bluetooth signal is supplemented by a \u201clast seen at\u201d feature in the app, which gives you an idea where to start looking.  The app also tells you whether the item you\u2019re seeking is nearby or not.<br \/><br \/>Second, the alarm on the Trackr Pixel device is pretty loud.  It isn\u2019t foghorn loud, but you can hear it clearly across a room, and you can hear an item that\u2019s in a nearby drawer.<br \/><br \/>Third, the Tracker Pixel uses a coin battery to power the alarm, but has no buttons to turn it on or off.  (The only button is for pairing.)  This means that the battery doesn\u2019t get used up by inadvertent key presses that happen while the item is being used, or carried in a pocket.<br \/><br \/>I suppose that the biggest negative about the Trackr Pixel is that you need an iOS or Android app to be able to find a lost item.  (As I said, there are no buttons to press for locating things.)  The apps also require location services to be turned on.  But I\u2019m okay with using the apps, because the Trackr Pixel gives me a fighting chance at locating my misplaced spare keys.<br \/><br \/>One last thing:  The Trackr app and the enabled Trackr skill work beautifully with Alexa for finding a smartphone.  This is almost worth the price of the Trackr Pixel.  If I\u2019ve mislaid my phone, all I have to do is say, \u201cAlexa, ask Trackr to ring my phone,\u201d and it rings right away."}

The black beanbag is about the size of a large cantaloupe, and is just heavy enough that it cannot be easily knocked over or knocked off a table.<br \/><br \/>The stand's viewing angle can be adjusted to an almost limitless  number of positions.  The holder itself can be rotated so that the iPad is held in a vertical or horizontal position.  Then the actual viewing angle can be adjusted by squishing the beanbag to find the most comfortable viewing position.<br \/><br \/>I purchased my first BEANPAD FOR iPAD from Woot! for the bargain price of $25 (including shipping).  But when my husband needed an iPad, too, I purchased a second BEANPAD FOR iPAD (this one) for him at full price, because it allows the iPad to be used comfortably just about anywhere in the house."}

First of all, the 2 camera system that we were using, allowed the cameras to be charged with a cable. The new ones use non-rechargeable ones. We've been using the new system for a few weeks now, and haven't had any low battery notifications, but it is a concern since we have 6 cameras! The system is easy to use. We love being able to access the cameras via our phones. When we were on vacation, we could tell when our pet sitter came to check on the animals. My husband can see when packages are delivered when he is downstairs in his office. We have been using one camera to find out which of our cats is not using the litter box! They're really handy. The quality of the images is very good, even when accessing it through our phones. When my husband was setting this up, he had to contact Arlo Customer Services. Evidently, you can only use 5 cameras without any extra fees. It was going to cost money to be able to use all 6 cameras. So as of now, we are only using 5 of them. Overall, we really do like the Arlo system and would recommend Arlo to our friends."}

I don\u2019t like the volume controls on the mask itself because the volume will not change unless you hold the buttons down and it goes so fast to be to loud or no volume. However it works great from your phone. The small cord comes out of the mask at your temple which trying to sleep comfortably can be awkward. I found if you pull the small cord up through the mask it does not bother your temple or cheek. I like how it tells you when you power the bluetooth on or off and when it connects.  However, the volume when turning on is loud so it is best to turn the blue tooth on when the mask is off your head.  Sound quality is great.  The battery life could be better.  It last just one night but that can be good because it is routine in remember as soon as you get up to plug it in."}

Scanning is done with ease and perfectly passes the data to my computer (where I e-mailed the scan to a friend). For the money, this printer is a great deal. It's not just a printer, but so much more, and for less than $100, it couldn't be much better of a deal. Now the bad part: I am not technically, computer inclined. I spent over an hour trying to get this to work wirelessly. My goal was to take the printer and stick it in a closet and out of view so it wouldn't be cluttering up my office space and would be functional without being in sight. I used the CD rom which came with the printer and read the directions from start to finish several times. Still couldn't get it to work. Anyway, my son will be home at the end of July for two weeks and I am going to see if he is able to get this to print wirelessly for me. I will update the rating on this and add additional comments if I can get it to work the way it was intended;. Like I said in my title, it may be just me..."}

The bottom of the laptop has an almost suede like feel to it and the packaging only enhances the feel of luxury.  It doesn't seem to fully fulfill the requirements of an ultrabook, it is definitely an aesthetically elegant machine.<br \/><br \/>As for Specs, the i5 with 500 Gig hard drive is plenty beefy, especially at the price that Amazon is selling this for.  It would be nice to have a little more memory but that is an easy upgrade.  We have used this for light gaming, mostly mine craft and it handles that with no problem.  I don't know that this would be a stellar gaming laptop though, but it is a rock solid personal laptop.<br \/><br \/>The biggest problem I have with it, is my own personal frustrations over windows 8.  I'm getting there with familiarity, but still having problems with Microsoft having spent decades teaching us how to navigate and work with computers to have them arbitrarily take easy control from us. But that's a rant for another time.<br \/><br \/>I have to admit that windows 8 looks sharp and stellar on this machine.  The video is clear and crisp.  We have watched streamed videos and they are great, with no lag.<br \/><br \/>I really can't say enough about the look and feel.  That and the very decent specs make this a great priced laptop at around $700."}

I was looking for a system for use in my family room with a new 3D television I had bought around Super Bowl time. I got the Sony BDV-N7100W system and I can honestly say that at about a third of the price of the Bose, the Sony excels with sound quality. I love the wireless speakers and have them spread out over about a 25 ft. area. The sound is incredible with strong lows and highs. The 3D Blu-ray player is also flawless in quality and completes my home theater system to a T. My teenage sons absolutely love this system and are spending more time now in the family room than the living room (solely for the reason on using the Sony).

{"rating":5.0,"title":"More Trouble to Wear, But Much More Sensitive Than Lumo Lift","text":"The UPRIGHT SMART WEARABLE POSTURE TRAINER is an &#34;anti-slouch&#34; posture trainer that really works!  I discarded my [[ASIN:B00N9P8GMW Lumo Lift]] after a week or so, because my sitting posture is pretty good, and I rarely slouched badly enough to trigger the Lumo Lift.  In contrast, the Upright buzzes me whenever I start to relax my posture even partway to a full slouch.<br \/><br \/>The Upright needs to be pasted to your back with gentle adhesive pads (60 included), rather than pinned to your clothing (like the Lumo Lift), but the greater sensitivity makes the extra effort worthwhile. Packets of one-time-use adhesive pads are available from the Upright web site for about $15.<br \/><br \/>You can wear the Upright between your shoulder blades if you're going to be standing, walking, and sitting; or at the small of your back if you're an Upright novice or generally sitting.  As long as it's turned on, the Upright works even without the accompanying app (Android or iOS) that tracks your training progress.  The Upright app uses Bluetooth to connect with the wearable Upright.<br \/><br \/>The app walks you through the simple setup, which mostly involves (1) finding the proper spot for placement on your back, and (2) calibrating the device so that it can detect a slouch.  Once it's calibrated, the device will gently buzz you whenever you sink into a slouch--which inevitably happens as your muscles tire from holding a single position--so that you can straighten up.  (There is no sound. The product page video that demonstrates the buzz is kind of amusing.)<br \/><br \/>When you create an account (free), the app collects information about your height, weight, and age, and then generates a daily posture training program that is personalized for you.  The training program begins with your wearing the device for a few minutes, and then for longer and longer sessions.  At the end of a session, the app gives you a score, based on how long you held your upright posture.  (Mine was only 86%, because I intentionally slouched to test the buzz.)<br \/><br \/>The Upright arrives fully charged.  The app tells you how much charge is remaining in your Upright.  When you're charging the device in the supplied charging dock, a solid red light tells you that it's properly connected and charging."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A powerful Bluetooth speaker with great sound, AM\/FM radio, lights, and microphone","text":"I purchased four Bluetooth speakers for my house over a several year period. I have a [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]], which is not very good and a [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] which does not work when paired with some devices and, when it does pair well, it usually lacks the powerful sound I am looking for.<br \/><br \/>I also purchased an [[ASIN:B00SNBCBBY ION Audio Block Rocker (iPA76A) | Portable Bluetooth Speaker]] at Costco which I absolutely love. As a result, I wanted another one of these but they were no longer available at Costco and I did not want to pay more for it on Amazon. Therefore, Costco had this speaker for $79.99 plus tax. Although, I love my Block Rocker a tad more (because I do not like the lights on this one), this is an excellent speaker. It pairs well with many devices including my Nexus 7, HP Omen, and iPad Pro. The sound is powerful and seems like surround sound indoors. I purchased both ION speakers for indoors but they are more for an outdoor environment.<br \/><br \/>When indoors, the AM\/FM radio does not work well even with the antenna. I also do not need the microphone feature and do not like the lights for my purposes. If I were running a disco or was just playing music for a party, then I would love the lights. There are many versions of the lights including a star formation, pulsating to music type lights, just a movement of light colors, etc.Every time I turn the unit on, I have to cycle through all the light settings to turn the lights off. I wish it remembered my last setting but it does not. What I do like is that it automatically turns on Bluetooth and is ready for pairing. My other ION always require I wait a few seconds and then press a Bluetooth button to start the pairing.  This speaker has the option but it is usually not needed. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I have used it for several hours already and it remains fully charged based on the indicator.<br \/><br \/>I love this speakers sound. It is extremely powerful and loud. The extra I am free to ignore."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Works faster than my Amazon lightening cable for me but works slower for my boyfriend","text":"Both my boyfriend and I each bought one of these cables in the teal blue because we liked the color and the 10-foot length. At my house, this cable works faster than my Amazon lightening cable. I timed several charges from 80% on four iPads and it took 45 minutes to charge from 80%. On my Amazon lightening cable it took 75 minutes.  However, when using this same cable (meaning the one he purchased) at my boyfriend's house, it takes almost double the time to charge both on my iPad and his. Therefore, I am not sure if it is the cable he received or the connector on his power strip.<br \/><br \/>I am certainly happy about my results and rate this 4 stars but my boyfriend's experience is like a typical cable and  his experience is more like 2.5 stars.<br \/><br \/>In summary, the results for this cable is probably hit or miss depending on what one gets.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 7\/9\/20 - My boyfriend called the company (number on the back of the box) because his cable is not working well; it is supremely slow. They refused to help him and said that the 10-foot cable is supposed to be slow. Therefore, even though my cable works well, I have lowered my rating to 2 stars because their cables appear to be hit or miss.

But this little speaker wins it hands down for being so compact.  I am looking forward to throwing this speaker into my bag and listening to it at work.  I also loved this speaker as it allows me to use my shuffle, nano or classic (which the ihome only allows for the bottom insert to be used) whereas the x-mini uses the earphone port (more universal for the different ipod models).<br \/><br \/>I also like this speaker as it uses the universal USB port to charge the chargeable battery in the speakers.  I hope these rechargeable batteries last a long time!  I dont think they are replaceable looking at the build of the speaker.<br \/><br \/>For the price,this is a great little speaker and so easy to carry around.

You say the wake word, you give a command or question, it responds. It does have a speaker itself, but it doesn't get as loud as the original Echo or the Tap. All of the devices will sync together in one Amazon app, but they all still work independently. Meaning, if I set an alarm on the Dot, only the alarm on the Dot goes off. But with the app on my phone, I can access all the devices in the one place. The Original Echo is better for larger areas. the Dot is ideal if you already have a sound system you would like to connect the Dot to, or small spaces like bathrooms or bedrooms. The Dot is great for kids. My daughter has it in her room so she can ask it how to spell words and such. The Tap is an entirely different beast, in my opinion. No wake word. Touch and talk. But it works via Bluetooth and wifi for on the go use using your cellular device. The Echo Dot does not come with a remote. Like the Original Echo, it needs to be plugged into the wall and needs wifi. (The Tap has a chargeable battery.) They are all great devices, though Amazon still has some work to be done on them.

As an aside, according to the Apple App Store, the developer does not collect any data from your phone (see pic); this is the reason I did not deduct a star for this.<br \/><br \/>My second gripe with the app, is that the it is a little rudimentary. Not particularly polished; and a little buggy at times (e.g. I couldn't get effects to kick in after selecting them on the app (I'd have to do it multiple times before the light would react), the light wouldn't always connect on the first try, etc. This was not the norm, but it happened a few times during my testing.<br \/><br \/>Now onto the good: First and foremost, it is BRIGHT. Brighter than similarly-sized lights. Physically, it feels well-designed. It has a 2000 mAh battery (I expected 1000 mAh). It is intuitive to operate and you can use it without the app if necessary (setting color temp, intensity, etc. No effects). There is a USB-C port for charging and a small display on the top, which shows battery %, time remaining (!), and color settings.<br \/><br \/>The soft cover on the front is attached magnetically, and can be attached to the back when you take it off (!); a wonderful design touch that is much appreciated. The light can also be affixed to metal surfaces via the magnet in the back.<br \/><br \/>The app, while barebones, provides a lot of functionality. There are many effects to choose from, and even a \"music\" mode in which the light will pulse to the beat of music picked up by your iPhone (or whatever device you are running the app on).<br \/><br \/>Overall, I have been really pleased with this light."}

I just lightly tap the ON \/ OFF button for it to come on. I press hold the dimmer button to cycle through the brightness levels I want. The unit is now set and will remember my settings as long as the unit remains in standby mode (meaning the A\/C power cable is not removed)<br \/><br \/>- The light brightness levels are mood enhancing and are easily cycled through with a light press of the finger.<br \/><br \/>- This can also be used as a room background light.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this is a good, small, basic, lightweight, and \"all bulb in-your-face\" type light that acts as a mood enhancing lamp or even as sort of a night light. The controls are on the top back and once one gets used to the location, a tap of the finger is all that is needed to operate. My 94-year old friend loves these lamps and he has three so far. He is partially blind and uses the highest setting to see when he gets up during the night for the bathroom and at night in the kitchen and in the parlor. The tap feature helps him because he can't see well. On a scale of 1-5 he gives this 10 stars. The current price of $26.99 ($35.99 minus 25%) is a bit pricey. These used to sell for $19.99 when he purchased them from another vendor. However, the prices have been increasing as these become more popular."}

The packaging I got the mouse and was really nice, really simple, but easy to open. The mouse was easy to set up, and the RGB looks pretty cool. There is a really cool DPI changer function that makes gaming much easier, however, I can't recommend this mouse for gaming because the ergonomics are pretty trash. I have to cramp my hand like a claw over the top of the mouse and after long periods of use it does start hurting. The surface is also pretty slippery, so I found that my hand slips on the mouse all the time. The tracking however, is great! And I would have to say that biggest plus is the battery life. I got this about 2 weeks ago, charged it once, and it is yet to die! I think the features of this mouse are great, but I would not recommend it. Purely because of the ergonomics, if you are going to use this mouse often, then you probably should go if something more ergonomic."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"JBL Balboa Sub10 is a worthy contender","text":"Although the JBL Balboa Sub10 delivers very good performance for a relatively modest price, I would never refer to it as \"the little subwoofer that could.\"  That's because it's far from little; this thing is quite big by my standards.  However, considering that the function of a subwoofer is to reproduce low-pitched audio frequencies, I'll accept that fact that it's the size it needs to be do its job well.<br \/><br \/>Because I live in a multi-family building and have neighbors with which I share walls, I have not been able to crank up the volume beyond medium.  That being said, I have been quite pleased with the bass sound and have not experienced any distortion with this subwoofer at the volume range that I have used.  Audiophiles who do not have cost as an object will no doubt want a more expensive subwoofer than the Sub10.  However, for the rest of us who are just looking for a dependable, reasonably priced subwoofer for our sound systems, the JBL Balboa Sub10 is a worthy contender."}

It folds flat with all the accessories, including legs completely flat and compact. Everything has a place under the table, securely held until you set it up again.  You don't have to put the cup holder or phone holder on if you don't want to. The top is black and the legs are a silver tone metal - just a pictured. The table portion slides to expand... or stays small and useful. The cup hold is rather small... and the phone holder has a foam insert to hold most phones expect the extra wide ones.  I will say that the phone holder is a bit shallow... but it holds my samsung g7.  The legs are adjustable to a wide range heights. Honestly, for the price it's a really awesome deal. Not SUPER solid - as you can imagine you won't be able to stand on them... but for a laptop or to pay the bills.. read a book with free hands.. play on your tablet.. it's plenty good.  Especially if you have limited space!  We bought two and in my personal opinion they are worth the price, or a bit more.

I wish they'd have a tiny little dot of a light on it though because sometimes I can't tell if I turned it off or not.  There were days that I thought it was off and walked away, only to come back to a speaker that had been on for over 48 hours.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Adequate, functional, a little large, no lights to show functioning ports","text":"Pretty much a plug and play device; 1 minute to install.  There is supposed to be a configuration program that you can access, but I wasn't able to do so with the IP address given in the instructions.  It wasn't necessary anyway, as the device functions just fine on a simple network without any additional configuration.  There are two things I didn't like about it compared to my old switch, that I was replacing.  First of all, it is a bit larger than my old switch at 8 1\/2 inches long compared to my old one that is only 6 1\/2 inches.  Also, the power supply is considerably larger at 6 inches long and 3 inches wide and 1 inch thick.  My old switch uses only a large plug that is 1 3\/4 x 1 3\/4 x 1 1\/4.  The second thing I didn't like is that there are no indicator lights to show the functioning ports.  My old switch has lights for each port that is working, which is nice.  You may prefer not to have any lights and if so, this Linksys switch may be to your liking.  Note: there is a disc included with documentation, but I didn't find it to be of any particular use.  On the plus side, this does appear to be a quality, heavy duty switch, so might be well suited for a commercial application (such as in an unattended area, like a computer room in a large business).  It appears to weigh nearly twice what my old switch did, so it is solid.  I have used Linksys products before and found them to be good quality with no issues.  You can buy a cheaper switch that is smaller and does essentially the same thing at a considerably lower price, but you most likely won't get the same quality as you would with this switch.  Also this switch does apparently have a POE (power over internet) feature and if you need that, you also might want to get this.  I don't see a need for POE in my configuration.  Possibly overkill for typical home office, but if you want a good quality switch, it might be worth the extra cost (or not)."}

All you gotta do then is hold the middle button down to turn on until the lady says &#34;power on&#34;, let go of the button when she says this -- and boom -- &#34;head phones connected&#34;.  Very very easy.<br \/><br \/>I use it mainly for the gym and doing stuff around my apartment.  I sweat like crazy and they still hold up like a champ.  They fit so well into your ears they are completely locked in.  Sound quality is very good and they are also very loud if you like to blast music like me (rap, metal, anything sounds good with these).  Bass is solid for headphones.  Don't really understand all the negative reviews on this but I have had these for at least 2-3 years and they are holding up perfectly.<br \/><br \/>If you buy these DEFINITELY take the time to watch a YouTube video on how to fold the cord with the brackets they give you so it fits nicely around the back of your head.  Very simple and doesn't take long, you only have to do it once and you're good.<br \/><br \/>Only complaint is VERY VERY rarely you won't hear anything when you hold down the middle button and you have to plug the charger in and press the middle button 9 times and repeat this process until you hear &#34;power on&#34;.  Usually takes a few tries but this has rarely ever happened so I still give 5 stars for these headphones.<br \/><br \/>Don't listen to these reviews and go out and try it for yourself.  They really are the GOAT and I have tried a lot of headphones."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Works Better Than Expected","text":"My husband has been wanting a sit-stand desk for a while now. Although this isn't an actual desk, it can be used with an existing desk to raise your computer. It's much heavier than we expected. At first we thought we were going to have to bolt it down to the desk, but that's not the case. We were hesitant to permanently attach it to our furniture, but fortunately the base is strong enough to keep the attachment stable. It even holds up to our kitty's occasional bunting. Assembly was pretty easy. Picture directions are included and were simple enough to follow. It works better than expected. I thought it might be a pain to raise and lower it, but it's really not. The surface has enough space for the keyboard and mouse. Overall, this is pretty good. Though after using this for a several weeks, my husband thinks he would prefer a desk that completely raises and lowers  over this, but until he can afford to get one, this will do the job."}

That isn't really the fault of this cover, but rather Apple's insistence on changing things up constantly. It is a really cute cover and I was pretty upset that it didn't work.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Interesting Gadget, Works as Advertised, But Tied to Smartphone","text":"This SAMSUNG GEAR S2 SMARTWATCH (Dark Gray) is an interesting gadget, and works as advertised.  It's kind of fun to make and receive telephone calls from your wristwatch (just like Dick Tracy did in the comic strips with his 2-way wrist radio).  However, to be able to make calls, you need to register it with your cellphone network (on Verizon, this entails a $30 activation fee, plus $5 a month thereafter).<br \/><br \/>You can use the Gear S2 for lots of things without activating the phone, of course.  There is a fitness tracker app, and there are interactive watch faces that can keep you abreast of your favorite teams' real-time game scores, the current stock market numbers, and other things.  However, I like my [[ASIN:B00N2BW2PK Fitbit-Charge-Wireless-Activity-Wristband]] much better for telling time and for activity tracking--the Fitbit is easier to use, and does more things reliably.<br \/><br \/>The biggest drawback regarding the apps, is that they are tied to your smartphone.  All of the Gear S2 apps use Bluetooth for running the app from your phone.  This means your smartphone has to be turned on, within the Bluetooth range, and charged, for the apps to work.  One problem that I never solved with the NBA watch face, was that the real-time scoring updates would stop when my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge went into sleep or dormant mode after about an hour.<br \/><br \/>Finally, the Gear needs frequent charging--every day or two.  This means you can't really treat it like a watch that you leave on your wrist 24\/7.  You have to treat it like a cellphone, and take it off for charging every night.<br \/><br \/>A negative about activating the phone--boo to Verizon!--is that my assigned phone line had been previously assigned to someone who had a lot of people still looking for him\/her.  Thus I got a lot of unwanted calls from the moment the Gear S2 was fully activated.<br \/><br \/>My Gear S2 was free (from a Samsung\/Verizon deal with my preorder of the Galaxy S7 Edge).  I'm very glad that I didn't pay a couple of hundred dollars for mine, as it turned out that I have no need for a smartwatch."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"NOT antiglare; screen protector","text":"Not antiglare, but as an added protection to the solid glass ipad screen, then I am sure it provides another layer of protection.  More effective for protecting against scratches, but if you have the cover then that alone provides the bulk of the anti-scratch protection; but will help if the ipad slipped out of your hand and glazed against a hard and sharp object: that one in a million probability, but could be higher if you are accident prone like me!<br \/>It is essential to clean your ipad screen beforehand and I use a window cleaner to remove the hand grease before applying the film.  The product comes with a smoother (a hard piece of plastic measuring ~3 by 2\") to help push the air bubbles as you apply the film - definitely helpful.  There is only one film that comes with this product, but it was easy to apply even if it took a few lifts here and there.<br \/>Value for money, a tad expensive for just a protection screen, wished it had the anti-glare, but worth a lot to the accident prone owners, or latter with kids."}

It's pre-cut to exactly fit the Kindle Fire touch screen, and it presses on without any need for additional adhesive.  After the film is applied, there is no loss of sensitivity in the touch screen.<br \/><br \/>The application process is very simple:  (1) clean the screen thoroughly, using the included microfiber cloth; (2) use the #1 tab to remove the plastic stiffener\/shield from one side of the double-sided film; (3) position the uncovered side of the film on the Kindle Fire screen (holding the film by the #2 tab, starting at one corner, and allowing the film to fall gently onto the screen); (4) use the included smoothing card to get rid of bubbles; (5) use the #2 tab to remove the remaining plastic stiffener\/shield; and (6) use the smoothing card again to get rid of any bubbles.  The whole process took me less than 10 minutes.<br \/><br \/>Whenever I apply screen protector film, I usually have to try two or three times to get everything right.  With this kit, the first application was successful, because the film adhered properly at the edges, and all but one tiny bubble smoothed out.  Now, should I ever need to re-apply the film, I have the second shield in reserve.<br \/><br \/>It's probably worth noting that the Kindle Fire has a larger screen than an iPhone or iPod Touch or camera viewfinder, so that the risk of getting dust particles under the film during application to the Fire is higher.  Also, it may not be necessary to install protective film on the Fire at all, because the touch screen is supposed to be made of particularly tough, scratch-resistant glass."}

It did require me to download more apps on my phone such as Galaxy Wearable. This watch is easy to use. There are 2 controls. The Michael Kors one had 2 controls, too, but their location was always accidently getting bumped which sometimes caused it to restart when I didn't want it to. I have never accidently bumped these buttons. The strap that comes with it barely fits my wrist, but there's an extra longer one that comes with it. It comes with a charger. The watch claims to stay charged for days. Well, technically that's true. I find that it lasts for 2 days so every other day I need to recharge it. My former watches both had to be charged every night, so I am pleased that this lasts a little longer. As far as the fitness aspect, this is better than my other ones. The step tracking seems to be more parallel to what I used to get from my Fitbit. The other smart watches were always really low in my step count which frustrated me. It tracks heart rate and stress levels. You can track fitness routines. The messaging feature is good, but I find it a little more difficult to reply to texts than my other watches.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great for exercise without the cord","text":"Pros:<br \/>1. Wireless BT works great. 35 plus feet. I've tested using in another room from my phone about 30 feet with the door closed. Did not drop the signal.<br \/>2. Noise isolation is very good. Can't hear my kids yelling and the dog barking.<br \/>3. Quality of sound is very good. Bass is good.<br \/>5. Charge lasts at least 4 hours from my testing. They will last longer but I have not tested beyond that. They recharge in about an hour or so. Standard USB connector for charging is good. So I can use other cables if need be.<br \/>4. Fit works very well after getting used to putting them on. They do not fall off during jogging or other high motion exercises.<br \/>6. BT connects automatically after first setup. My other BT headphones do not and it's an extra painful step that these allow me to skip.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>1. Fit gets to be uncomfortable after longer uses. This is acceptable, as these need to be secure in your ear so they don't fall out while moving around or exercising. I would not recommend if you will be using for longer periods of time, as comfort will probably be an issue. Not as much a Con on the product but the type of headphone.<br \/>2. Profile could be a bit smaller. They sick out a bit far but not any more than other BT headphones I've seen. I would have liked to wear these under my motorcycle helmet but they stick out too far."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Slim, Beautiful Cover Offers Good Protection, But Lacks Wake\/Sleep Feature","text":"There's a lot to like about this BELKIN CHAMBRAY COVER for the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet.  It's slender (adding little bulk), but has a hard shell and a sturdy cover that offer good protection when the big tablet is knocking around in a backpack, tote bag, or large purse.  There's a built-in stand that's easy to deploy, with three viewing angles.  The two-tone, slate-blue color scheme is elegant, and the silky \"chambray\" textured fabric on the cover is both beautiful and pleasant to touch.<br \/><br \/>However, the Belkin Chambray Cover has two significant drawbacks.  One, it has no automatic wake\/sleep feature (to turn your HDX on or off when the cover is opened or closed).  Two, the built-in stand wobbles when you use the touch screen, especially when you're using a stylus.  The stand is in no danger of collapsing, but it's not as solid as you'd like to see in a touch-screen tablet stand.<br \/><br \/>This would be close to the perfect cover for my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet, if only it had the wake-sleep feature.  But because of the two drawbacks, I rate the Belkin Chambray Cover at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale)."}

Couldn't be happier. Lastly the  phase must be set to different degree if their are 2 subs in the room cause if they are set to the same the bass will cancel each other and that also applies if the other speaker set to large and is outputting bass than the sub phase from receiver should be changed to reverse tried it with differnt setting but this thing pumps out very clean bass in music and when it's movie time this thing transform to something else you hear every explosion a jet flying, a shootout you hear every single detail I would definitely buy this again."}

My phone (note 8) had a little trouble connecting at first but turns out my watch (gear s3) was being ornery. Once that was resolved it connects fine.<br \/><br \/>Just one thing I'd change. The blinky lights. They're cool for about a minute. Then the realization sets in that not only can I not have it just glow a color, it keeps blinking in this annoying pattern and there's no way to turn it off. I bought this speaker to sit on the counter in my master bath. I'd intended to keep it plugged up in there so I didn't have to mess with turning it on or off. Not blinking, it may have made a cool nightlight... But blinking it's like a disco nightlight. It's rather bright. I haven't seen it yet with all the lights off (like if I'm going to sleep) but I can imagine it's going to look like a party in my bathroom. :-D"}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Seem to be good quality; no failures yet","text":"I have only burned about 4 of these DVDs before writing this review, but so far, no problems with any of them.  Over the years I have bought a lot of different brands of DVDs and CDs, but found sometimes there a bad one in the pack and also that some of them fail after a few years.  For that reason, I now usually only buy a few top brands.  I thought it was worth trying the Amazon brand disks, even if they aren't one of the brands that I normally buy.  From the looks of them, they appear to be made by a top manufacturer with acceptable quality and I fully expect them to last for a number of years.  Time will tell, but I think these are worth a try.  Note that the price is not the best price you can get.  This is only a pack of 30 and you can get a pack of 50 for about the same price with some other top brands."}

Just received this TV 24inch in for my kitchen, beautiful, color, so easy to set up, needed no help from my husband. Even the clicker is first class. So easy to adjust on this TV. I am so pleased I purchased this quality product. It is no cheap looking. I went to Sams for Black Friday, no Samsung even close for this price, another brand was $299.00 for the 24 inch. I already told my husband, if Samsung makes the product it is first class. Since I am from Germany I own a Bosch washer for the last 15 years, I would not hesitate to replace it with a Samsung.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"BEST KEYBOARD EVER MADE (IMHO) BUT HAS SOME SMALL ISSUES","text":"Have used this keyboard for many years at work and home and I wouldn't use any other keyboard.  It is that comfortable.  I would hate to pay the price they are asking for these now.  Hate to say this for those of you who want one, but I just bought one for $2.99 from Goodwill.  It is well worth it to have a spare on hand; actually have 2 spares, as obviously these are expensive to replace if you buy new. These keyboards have both USB and PS\/2 type connectors and two USB ports in the back of the keyboard which I have never used.  I tried out the USB ports in the back and they do not work.  There could be a couple of reasons for this.  One might be that in order for them to function, you might have to use the USB connector for the keyboard, rather than the round PS\/2 connector.  Another reason is that my keyboard does not connect directly to the computer, but goes through a KVM switch.  Through the switch, the keyboard may not receive enough power to power the USB ports.  I don't have a USB connector on my KVM switch, so I have to use the PS\/2 round connector.  The only problem that I have encountered with this keyboard is the feet that elevate the back of the keyboard to a comfortable angle, tend to fall off.  I have lost a couple and cannot find replacements.  If you are used to a flat keyboard, the tilted ergo keyboard does take some getting used to, but once you have used it for a while, you will never go back to a flat keyboard again.  Microsoft has some newer versions of this keyboard, but I don't think they are an improvement and they are expensive."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Crisp Sound, a little less so with Blue Tooth","text":"I truly love these headphones for style.  They are a little bulky but you can tell that style was high on the designer's list.  I have been using a pair of Sennheiser headphones exclusively and I feel that the sound on these are a little crisper and the sound canceling is comparable.  I have no complaints at all on the corded sound these produce.  I'm a little less happy with the Bluetooth which works well when close to the bluetooth source and have a line of sight between the two.  These work beautifully when listening to books on tape on walks - perhaps a little too well and cutting me off from the environment.<br \/><br \/>I do wish they would fold up a little smaller, so Sennheiser will continue to be my traveling headphones, but these have found a place wired to my computer for late night music and video enjoyment. The price is a little high for dedicated wired headphones though."}

However we intend to relocate it to the basement to replace a smaller and older TV. There's a TV stand down there which we will set this upon because that's the TV where all the gaming systems are so we need a place for those to be stored. The TV has an excellent picture quality.

I was looking for something straightforward with instructions, Connections and remote control that wouldn\u2019t break the bank-and this fit the bill!! (owning one in past when they first came out.. it was pricey + not user friendly.. So, just know these have changed a lot for the better!!)<br \/><br \/>Realistic expectations is a must for an $80 projector.. don\u2019t expect Dolby\/HD in theater movie quality but, rather something to suffice + provide a bigger picture shown on the wall\/screen then you receive with standard TV. Tbh, $ was a big reason choosing this option- I didn\u2019t want to worry about teens possibly breaking.. Or, get too high tech and difficult to connect- that\u2019s where this steps up in spades!! I have included photo showing multitude of devices this connects with- since kiddos seem to have so many items they want to connect a big screen too.. this was perfect for that need! Easily compatible to a TV, laptop, iPhone, photo stix or even the game box.. it\u2019s so universal.<br \/><br \/>With our last projector had issues with brightness- this does not\u2026 not sure what\/why causes that? But know- we had a bright and solid picture playing Mario kart on Xmas day.. this was using at 80\u201d size. Getting much bigger then 80\u201d size may distort the picture\/blur the images.. Having said that, this may perform clearer on a movie screen(?) In our hotel room- we broadcast on a textured white wall so, I\u2019m sure it didn\u2019t help with clarity.<br \/><br \/>If choosing, I highly suggest investing in a carry all to store\/transport.. something to keep all items (cords, remote, instructions) in x1 place and keep projector safe as well.. after all, these need to be cared for- especially with travel (see photo of travel bag idea included!) **Keeping instructions in carry case is so helpful for quick refresh connecting to chosen device- And helps for a successful movie premiere! Hoping this info helps your decision.. stay safe."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fast data storage that's water and magnet proof","text":"I got this to backup my photos and two movies from a Dell Latitude E6430 running Windows 7 with  Service Pack 1.<br \/><br \/>I did not even have to format the drive.  I just inserted it into the SD card reader and began copying.  In total I transferred over 7.4 GBs in pictures and movies.  On the first transfer, I copied 1.35GB in 1 minute and 42 seconds, which I felt was incredibly fast.  The additional transfers were just as fast.<br \/><br \/>The package says this has a read speed of up to 90MB\/s and write speed up to 80MB\/s; is water proof, shock proof, magnet proof, temperature proof, and X-ray proof; and comes with a 10-year limited warranty.<br \/><br \/>For fun, I subjected this memory card to two strong magnets (one magnet is used to find wall studs).  I then verified that the data was still there.  I also dropped this into a full glass of water, fished it out, dried it off, and then verified that the data was still there. I also played a movie directly from the card and it loaded instantaneously.<br \/><br \/>It backs up my pictures and movies extremely fast and did not require I format the card and for that I love it."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"OK+","text":"Pretty good value for the money. For me, a bit of a learning curve, new to Windows 8 from Windows 7. I like that it runs Netflix streaming films well, with good sound and excellent screen resolution. So, will probably use it for it and Gmail, YouTube, Facebook and various web sites. Since it has no CD\/DVD drawer, I can't install the programs I have, nor can run DVD's from my collection. Plus, some of my programs don't run on Windows 8. So, no easy migration from Windows 7 to 8 for me and a less feature-loaded computer than my Dell desktop. That said, I do like the touch screen feature of this laptop with Windows 8 (this is 8.0, while 8.1 is  a better version}. But, 8.0 seems fine for me, especially since I didn't notice any major limitations or problems. So, OK and a pretty good value, especially as a way to get used to Windows 8. I also have a Nexus 7 tablet. So, this laptop fits nicely as a complement to my other computers."}

Anyway, I was concerned with the size of his netbook to properly do school work. So, I bought a mouse and also got this Logitech compact keyboard. It is absolutely perfect for this use. A great compact size to work on his desktop. I use the netbook with a monitor, mouse, docking station and this keyboard and you would never know he wasn't working from a full size set up. He loves the number pad on the keyboard (something he missed on the netbook). I would definitely recommend this keyboard for anyone in the market for a new one. It's compact, but has everything you need. The 'action' is great, it's lightweight, I can't say enough good things about it!"}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great handheld ham radio","text":"The BF-F9 V2+ is my new bff.  This is my first ham radio, and it seems like a solid choice.  Lots of features, solid performance, no glitches, good reception.  Can pick up a repeater 2 miles away crystal clear using the stock antenna as-is out of the box.  Incidentally, there are two companies that are authorized resellers of Baofeng radios, and the BF-F9V2+ is only sold by this one, Firstvision Technologies aka Amcrest in Houston, TX.  This model is essentially the same as the BF-F8HP with a slightly different shell design which looks more conformal and ruggedized to me.  This BF-F9V2+ comes with a BL-5 1800mAh battery that slides and snaps easily in place securely and conforms in size precisely to the radio itself.  The battery can be charged  by itself or with it installed on the radio using the same charger and cradle. The assembly, shell, switches, and buttons on this BF-F9V2+ are rock solid and actually has the Baofeng name molded in the plastic in more places than the BF-F8HP.  .  .  and it's a 9 which must be better than an 8, right? ;)  It's a nice radio I'm happy with it so far."}

Especially when I was looking for a pair for my kids to use on road trips.<br \/><br \/>The kids did appreciate them.  They are not completely isolating but they isolated enough to let them listen to their music over road noise while driving.  They will definitely be a part of our road trip equipment from now on.<br \/><br \/>The fit seems to be better for the kids than for me.  Perhaps my head is too big, but they felt a bit tight for me.  Kids report they fit great.  I'm not sure that an audiophile would really appreciate these, but for the price, my kids love them."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Classy, Functional, I Love It","text":"I don't think I asked a lot in a iPad cover, but I'm impressed how well this cover has delivered.  Mostly I was looking for functional protection and a look that classy looks. This cover delivered both in spades.<br \/><br \/>Protection:<br \/><br \/>I love the way the iPad is held in place by the four rubber corner holder.  The case makes contact with the iPad in the most minimal way and does not allow grit to get between the case and the ipad to scratch surfaces.  I have never had the iPad slip out of these feet either, it is very snugly held in place.<br \/><br \/>The outside materials are rugged and there are 3\/16th inches of touch material between the iPad and the harsh world.  It will not protect it in a long fall, but it is safe from scratches and smudges.<br \/><br \/>Looks:<br \/><br \/>I was originally looking for a leather case for looks, but this is just as classy as the leather cases I have found for twice the price.  I like the leatherlike surface and the black with white stitching is subtly striking.  I even like the Belkin logo, it's a cute representation of the human form.<br \/><br \/>Functionality:<br \/><br \/>The magnet is well placed to hold the case closed, then when open, it holds the front flap securely attached to the back of the iPad.  Magnet strength seems to be strong enough to be functional.  Also well designed are the multiple positions the case folds into.  It has a great adjustable angle fold for watching movies and using my bluetooth keyboard.<br \/><br \/>I don't use the camera ever, but this case does have a strategically placed hole so it is available.<br \/><br \/>Failings:<br \/><br \/>In general this is a great case.  The two things I can think of for constructive criticism are the inside materials and the fact that the magnet causes the iPad to wake in transit.  For the inside material, it is a velvety black material that picks up dust. Not a huge thing, but noticeable.  As for the magnet, I guess this is not uncommon, but I do completely power down the iPad if I am putting it in my laptop bag.  Otherwise it occassionally turns on and runs down the battery.  Again not a bad thing and not an issue in general.<br \/><br \/>Summary:<br \/><br \/>All in all, I love this case. It's classy and functional.  Recommend."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Like other things Netgear, it kind of works for a while and then it dies","text":"I had a Netgear MR814 that worked half-decently for around four years and then for some reason totally stopped transmitting internet wirelessly.  Bought this new one through Amazon for $40 and it worked OK for a few months before it stopped transmitting internet as well.  So I bought a Linksys instead and there's a stark difference.  No more restarting my router every other day to get it to work, and NO MORE NETGEAR FOR ME!  There's a reason I guess why their routers are less expensive.  Do yourself a favor and pay the extra ten dollars for another brand like Linksys.<br \/><br \/>If you do buy this one note that when I followed the instructions on the included setup CD it didn't work.  When I just did the setup manually it worked fine.  If you know anything at all about wireless routers then I suggest you set it up manually without the CD."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Great on paper -- but I just sent it back after trying it for two days","text":"This thing looks great but sounds and works poorly.  I did a lot of research before purchasing and I thought this was the player to get (I wouldn't touch Apple, especially since radio is important to me).  It had everything I wanted plus 8 gigs of (expandable) memory.  But after learning how to use it, loading it up with music, pics and videos, and trying it for two days I sent it back.  Pros and cons:<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/><br \/>- Great (expandable) capacity at a great price.  Comparable Samsung and Creative products don't come close to holding this much music, video, etc.  There's a reason after all why memory is the number one selling point for MP3 players.<br \/>- Good screen.  Not as nice as the Samsung T9 (which is amazing), but still pretty nice.  Video and photos look good as long as you're looking from straight ahead.<br \/>- Good tactile control.  I really like the scroll wheel, which makes it easy to quickly cycle through menus and hundreds of songs.  With the Creative Zen V Plus and the Samsung T9 you're at the mercy of the joystick or button.<br \/>- FM radio that's recordable.  This is important to me.  I passed on the Creative because it doesn't record radio.  I wouldn't even consider an iPod because it has no radio at all (!!!).<br \/>- User-replacable battery.<br \/>- User interface is fast.  That's important.  A big strike against the Samsung is that it takes 3-4 seconds just to skip to the next song.  When it comes right down to it, usability is key.<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/><br \/>- FM reception is bad.  I live in a large city with lots of powerful FM stations that come in clear as day on every radio I've ever used.  But not with this thing.  Listening to FM is like listening to someone crumple a plastic bag.<br \/>- Recording functions are lame.  The FM record level is so low that even at full playback volume it's hard to hear the recording while on the train(which is OK because it just records lots of static anyway).  The voice recording lacks sensitivity.<br \/>- Scratches easily.  I was as careful as I could be with my new toy, and my first day taking it out of the house it still got 4 or 5 small scratches on the front before I even got to work in the morning.  Those little scratches are clearly visible and distort the light.  I can only imagine what it would look like after a few months.<br \/>- User interface is just adequate.  Wanna make a playlist on the fly?  Good luck, because you have to play each song first in order to add it to the list.  Wanna cue up the next song while listening to something else?  Good luck, because I couldn't find any way to do that very basic function (if it's there it's not readily apparent).  There are plenty of other quirks.  All in all, it looks cool but isn't that easy to use.<br \/>- The four outside buttons are a pain.  Control wheel is great.  Buttons around the control wheel?  Not so great.<br \/>- It's not large, but it is larger than its competitors.  The Samsung T9 is 1\/2 inch shorter and about 35% thinner.  The Creative Zen V Plus is thicker but also much shorter.  The iPod nano is of course much, much thinner and lighter.<br \/>- Volume is lacking.  Even with MP3s that I know have high volume, the e280 can sometimes require turning up the volume very high to get the sound you want.<br \/>- Editing MP3 tag information does no good once your files are loaded onto the machine.<br \/><br \/>So........overall I was disappointed and I thank Amazon for taking it back and refunding my money.  The e280 is much better to talk about than to actually use.  If FM and recording performance isn't important to you then you should add one star to this review.<br \/><br \/>And here's a tip if you do buy the e280 -- make sure the ID tag info on your MP3s is in order BEFORE you load up the machine.  Because changing the tag info once the machine is loaded up won't make the album, artist and song menus any better.  Do it first."}

This year we are returning to the same cabin and hoping to get some proof of our encounters.  Also, looking forward to documenting other interesting sightings and crashes so we were excited to try this camera out.<br \/><br \/>The camera itself has a rugged feel to it.  It is solid and has some heft for its small size that speaks of quality.  It was easy enough to install and turn on, but then it got a little more interesting.  The directions are a little cryptic, and it might be more fun to think you are in an escape room and need to get the camera working to get out.  The manual is grammatically challenge and reads more like repetitive clues to point to solutions.  It is almost comical.<br \/><br \/>The image and sound of the camera are pretty good.  We have had fun playing around with it and we are ready to have it roll next month in Northern Minnesota and on trips to mexico and costa rica.<br \/><br \/>All in all a decent dash cam with some interface and documentation issues, but it set up quickly and seems to record well.

I'm on some &#34;Ulitmate plan&#34; that's cheaper than a couple plans below it, some silly promo from silly TIme Warner.<br \/><br \/>Anyway one downer about this modem is if you have phone through Time Warner there is no jack for that on the TP Link modem\/router. Not a huge deal as according to the tech I talked to as long as it ran the WAN (Internet) connection of my own router they wouldn't charge me the lease fee to run the other one (current leased modem) for the phone only. I know, right? silly ISP... All this to save me the $8 a month lease fee. Also take note in order to do this at same coax location I had to get a splitter and 2 additional coax cables, easy enough because I had a bunch of that laying around. Problem was adding the spiller took just enough of the signal out so that only one of the two would register. Tier 3 TW tech said I could have a servic tech come out and tune the line but I just put it (the TW modem for phone only) in another room that had coax. Granted this will really only support a wired\/wireless phone type setup, so not optimal but better for me not to have to wait for a service tech."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Love my new Solo Messenger Bag!!!","text":"I absolutely love this Solo Pro Aegis! I previously had a beautiful backpack style case that I bought on Amazon last year that, when I looked at it, seemed to be everything I wanted. Well, after traveling internationally 3 times in the last 12 months, I needed to get something else. I found the fact that I would have to juggle suitcase, purse and backpack while going through customs, airports, etc, it just became impossible. I found myself unable to put the backpack on once I was getting through the lines so I ended up holding it most of the time which was just awful. This new Solo is fantastic. It is easy to swing over my shoulder, leaving my hands free. It's also so much thinner than my backpack, but with what seems to be far more storage capabilities than my old one. Pockets galore, padded beautifully, plenty of room for my 15&quot; laptop, bluetooth keyboard, mouse along with my Ipad pro and accessories. Also has plenty of room for other stuff as well (papers, etc). On top of it all it has extra security for me to feel safe in keeping my credit cards and other identity items close to me and with a security block. I couldn't be happier!"}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Perfect in a pinch- not everyday use..!!","text":"Very clever and convenient retractable multi style charger for cell phones or small devices. Clips onto a keychain, fits into a pocket or can even attach to backpack\/briefcase.. A set up such as this can save you in a tight spot when you are caught without a cord to charge a dying device.. especially on the go!<br \/><br \/>With physics of a lever\/pulley this will expand and retract making it ideal to keep cords wound up tiny and tucked away while carrying. This is a solid option for whenever you don\u2019t have access to your standard cord. *I find it doesn\u2019t have enough merit to be a daily charge cord.. it isn\u2019t made as robust as most cords used for everyday wear + tear. This cord is more prone to stress bends\/breaks that will make it obsolete.. hence my advice to use as a back up when caught without!!<br \/><br \/>If cord breaks- there is no way to replace this and setup becomes obsolete.. This is a solid option for any \u00dcber or Lyft driver to keep on hand- its perfect to offer any passenger access to charge a phone and such a great perk and customer service.. all for under $15.

We did not get the camera for the really low zoom abilities.  How did we find the RAW functionality: great for this very protable camera this size and the output was pretty awesome.  It is a little pricy, but a great learning tool for a budding photographer without all the weight and tripods that come with a professional sized camera.  Would recommend as an addtional camera for experiementing with RAW and other manual SLR functions."}

I have used it via Bluetooth and SD card and the sound is very nice.<br \/><br \/>I recommend using a high amp charging block or charger like the ones for the Samsung tablets or the big apple chargers. I have also seen some laptops with USB-c that would work which would definitely increase the speed of charging. The first time I charged it the battery light was at about 2\/3 full and it took almost 6 hours to fully charge it with a small charger.<br \/><br \/>I like the color green so this speaker is very nice to me.<br \/>You could also charge something with this speaker like a phone or small device. I have not tried it but it seems like it would work obviously it would reduce your play time.<br \/><br \/>Also, I did not know this when I bought it but if you have two of these speakers you can pair them to have true stereo sound."}

Came at a pretty good deal compared to other brands but functioned just as well.<br \/><br \/>The bonus stand is a random accessory to pair with this product. However, as far as stands go, it's pretty decent. It has very good grip and works well with any phone, and is sturdy.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>Not much really. Its compressed air and works as intended. Only downside is that it seems to leave a bit more cold condensation when you use it compared to other products.

What an improvement this internal TP-LINK ARCHER T8E DUAL BAND PCI EXPRESS ADAPTER makes over the quite satisfactory external  [[ASIN:B007ZLGXA8 Linksys AE3000 dual band adapter]] that I've used since October 2012.  Internet pages load much faster (on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands), and the wireless signal is stronger (5 bars, not 4).  My router is located in a room far from my home office, and the adjustable external antennas help pull in the best signal.<br \/><br \/>The Archer T8E adapter is a breeze to install.  Just open your computer's case, locate the PCI Express slot (the motherboard should identify it), insert the adapter, and close the case.  Then use the included Resource CD to install the driver and utility.  (The driver and utility can also be downloaded from the TP-Link web site.)  The Resource CD also contains a detailed user guide in .pdf format.  My CD arrived with a hairline crack (stuff happens!), but the software ran perfectly anyhow; and the adapter found and connected to my home wireless network without difficulty.<br \/><br \/>I really wish that I'd installed an internal wireless adapter a long time ago.

PD determines how much power each device needs, and ensures that it is NOT overcharged.<br \/><br \/>PD chargers have USB-C ports, so you need a cable with an oval USB-C plug (rather than the familiar flat USB plug) to connect your tablet, cellphone, etc. to the charger.  This cable with one lightning cable plug and one USB-C plug is exactly what you need for an Apple tablet or phone that uses a lightning cable.  It\u2019s amazing how much faster my iPad Air charges when I use the 18W charger with this cable!<br \/><br \/>The cable\u2019s braided cover is long-lasting.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Couldn't be more pleased!","text":"My son had a MAC which fell and ended up destroying the screen. So, without a computer to bring back to college, we started looking at a replacement. Long story short, with Macs being way to expensive at this economic time, I got him a netbook. Of course, it took some getting used to. One of his his principal complaints was trying to navigate the smaller 10\" netbook. When I saw this Verbatim 96781 Nano Wireless Notebook Optical Mouse I jumped at it. It was small enough that he could leave it plugged into his port without having to disconnect it when he was packing it up to take with him. Given his track record of losing stuff, to me that was a great feature. The ergonomic design of the mouse is not too big or small and fits perfectly for him to use. I know I never see him using the netbook anymore without the wireless mouse, so I know it's a tremendous asset for him. I am in the market now for monitor and maybe even a docking station now, so he will be able to actually set up a desk in his dorm with the netbook. The mouse is perfect for his use, it is economically priced, and I think you will be hard pressed to find something better. I rarely rate items here as a 4 star, but I feel I must with the Verbatim.

It is cute and seems pretty solidly made and and engineered except for a couple of small things. First, I screwed the holding plate into the bottom of my desk. This holds the cord tightly onto the bottom of the desk, but, when you use the plate to stick the PowerCube to the desk, it plugs into one of the outlet, so you actually only have 3 workable jacks.<br \/><br \/>Also it was of hard to know where to put the PowerCube.  I was hoping to plug the extension chord under the desk, but if I put it there, I cannot easily reach the USB ports. If I put the PowerCube on the desk, then it is a little ugly with the cables plugged into it. So I ended up mounting it beneath the desk top.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"I have mixed feelings about this GPS","text":"If you have never had a GPS, you won't have to relearn different menu options so from this perspective, this TOMTOM is certainly very functional and navigates as expected.  Setup is easy.  You just plug it in and follow the on-screen instructions.  Select the language you use during setup (many are available).  You also have the option to go through some on-screen tutorials and you'll be set to go almost immediately; just select navigate and plot your route. If you connect the GPS to the computer, you can go to the TOMTOM site and download one map update as long as it's within 30 days of purchase.<br \/><br \/>However, the TOMTOM website is not very intuitive and it was difficult to find the information I needed.  My recommendation is to create an account FIRST, then once you find where to download the appropriate TOMTOM software, connect your GPS and LINK the GPS to your account to continue.  Also, make sure you press the button on the lower right corner of the software before you disconnect the GPS so you don't get an error message to your screen.  I set this up on a MAC system; I suspect you will encounter a similar but harmless error with a Windows system.<br \/><br \/>This TOMTOM has many more features than I'm use to but has the same basic functionality as pretty much any other GPS.  The difference is in where you find that information.  The reason I have mixed feelings is because this TOMTOM is so different from the 11-month old Magellan GPS I have.  Also, there are a few features that just annoy me.  For instance, with my Magellan I can press one button to find the route in text format.  With the TOMTOM you have to make three selections to see the same thing - press once on the street name, then press once on the details button, then press the \"browse as text option,\" and now you see the route in text format.  Then when you want to get back to the map, you press done twice.  To me this is very frustrating because when I'm navigating, I like to bounce back and forth between the map and the written route.  However, I did not rate this GPS lower because of this since it's only my personal preference.<br \/><br \/>From a feature and option perspective, this GPS has a lot to offer. There are many points of interests (POIs), although the POIs are set up much differently than on my Magellan.  There are HELP instructions on what to do if your car breaks down and what the rules of the road are for different states. In addition to the these features, you can edit your own maps, you can zoom in on them, you find the gas stations with the cheapest fuel prices (providing you subscribe to the TOMTOM daily fuel price updates), etc., etc.  The reason I rated this TOMTOM three stars is because it offers too many selections making the system more complex than necessary, the screen is not as crisp as other GPS's I've seen,  and some of the basic menu options are not as intuitive or as easy to get to as they are on the Magellan.<br \/><br \/>Update as of 12\/05\/09:  I had my boyfriend try the GPS and he quickly became frustrated with the menu items and felt it was too complex.  Although he was originally going to rate this TOMTOM 2 stars; he now agrees with my rating of 3 after he was shown some features.  However, I had his 20-year old daughter try it and she loves the GPS and all the features it offers.  For instance, she liked the ability to change the arrow into a car as you follow the GPS map and all the data that is displayed on the screen.  She rates the GPS 4 stars only because the menus are sometimes a bit difficult to navigate.  So it seems the younger generation might like this more than the older generation who usually don't prefer all the bells and whistles."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Confusing charge indicator","text":"At first, I thought I had a defective unit that would not charge.  When charging, there is a light that comes on.  That light stayed red for the entire time I was charging the unit.  I thought it should change color when charged, but the manual says the light flashes while charging and then is steady when fully charged.  That being the case, the unit probably charged much quicker than I thought.  One confusing thing is that you have to hold the switch to turn it on for about 2 seconds before the unit comes on.  Off is instant as soon as you touch the switch.  Includes charging cord and 4 different nozzle tips for a variety of tasks.  It has two different speeds, but the slower speed didn't seem like it had enough power to do much.  The higher speed seemed sufficient for most tasks but didn't seem quite as strong as you would get from a can of compressed air.  Also has a light on the front to light up your work, which is a nice feature.  Comes with a storage bag, which seemed a little small, but does hold the item and the nozzles and the charger cord.  The big advantage with this device is of course that you don't have to keep buying cans of compressed air."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent cover for my new IPAD2","text":"To be honest, I got my IPAD about 2 months ago and purchased a bluetooth keyboard case (from Amazon of course). I was finding it to be a bit cumbersome to travel locally with, like going to the stores (although I admit it is nice to be able to type on a keyboard). Anyway, I was looking for an alternative case to be able to use as just a case (nothing to do with a keyboard). I saw this offered to me in Vine and figure I could give it an honest review. To start with, I didn't know if I would like the red plaid design of the cover. It is just gorgeous and I am so happy I got this. It looks smart (for either a man or a woman). The cover in general is padded and my IPAD2 is well protected. Inside there is a secure holders which snuggly fits my IPAD and on the alternate side on the cover is a side pocket for document storage and an elastic band which will keep any other items in place (i.e. a small calculator etc). I would see this as a great accessory for a business person who would like a little bit of storage with their case and it behaves almost like a small portfolio case. The back  corner of the cover has a perfectly fit hole which allows you to continue to use the camera feature while the IPAD 2 stays snug in the case. I honestly have nothing but good things to say about the Marco cover. It looks smart and protects my IPAD2, all while giving me some handy side features. To top it all off it has the Smart magnetic feature which puts the IPAD to sleep when closed and wakes it up when opened (saves battery life). I highly recommend, this is a great cover for all!!!"}

I'm also getting better range on all devices - at least Good reception for all devices throughout my house.

To set it up with an Android phone, you need two apps from Google Play: HPSmart, and HP Print Service Plugin.<br \/><br \/>SETUP.  Once you have HPSmart, you turn on the printer, open the app, and follow the prompts.  The app finds the printer, helps you connect it to your home network, and takes you through the process of loading paper, installing two ink cartridges, and aligning the copier.  From time to time, a prompt will tell you to press a lighted or flashing button on the printer in order to proceed.<br \/><br \/>The setup process isn\u2019t difficult, but you should start it when you have maybe 20-30 minutes to devote to it.  There are enough steps that you don\u2019t want to get interrupted in the middle.<br \/><br \/>HPSMART APP.  Something that I really love about the printer, is that I can use my phone to make it scan a document and send the document to an email address.  The phone can control all of the printer functions through the HPSmart display--it just takes a tap on a virtual button.  I asked the printer to print a photo from my phone\u2019s Gallery, and it came out beautifully.  The photo that I took outside my home with the phone\u2019s camera and immediately sent to the printer also came out beautifully.<br \/><br \/>MANUAL CONTROLS. You can also control the printer manually, at least for copying. When you open the printer cover, the buttons for the number of copies and copying light up.  However, this printer is easiest to control with the HPSmart app. (I need to visit the HP web site and download the full manual--the closest now is the Envy 6400 all-in-one printer manual--because the lighted buttons aren\u2019t quite intuitive.)  Other mobile devices on my home network (e.g., my iPad Air) are able to find the printer and use it like any other printer on my network.<br \/><br \/>SPEED; COPY QUALITY; INK  The printer is quite fast, and the quality of the printing is excellent.  The ink colors are bright and the printing is extremely crisp and clear (even with fine print).  The printer uses HP 67 ink cartridges--which are definitely NOT discontinued (as another reviewer reported).  My local Staples store has the ink in stock right now (July 2020).<br \/><br \/>INSTANT INK PROGRAM.  If you like, you can sign up for the optional HP Instant Ink program, and the printer will automatically order ink for you.  I chose the \u201cModerate\u201d program, which assumes printing about 100 pages per month, for $4.99 a month (after the first 2 months\u2019 free trial).  If you don\u2019t print that many pages, you can carry over the unused pages to a later month (up to a set number of pages).  You can cancel the Instant Ink program at any time.<br \/><br \/>APPEARANCE.  The printer has a sleek, low profile.  It\u2019s white, which means it will blend in with the decor of any room."}

It has 16 different ports, including 2x HDMI 2.0, 1x DisplayPort 1.4, 2x USB-A 3.2 Gen2, 2x USB-A 2.0, 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen2, 1x Ethernet, 1x SD, 1x TF, 2x 3.5mm Audio, 2x Power Delivery out (USB-A, USB-C; charge only).<br \/><br \/>One thing I really appreciate it that I can use the power delivery ports to charge even if my laptop isn't hooked up (because this is powered separately).<br \/><br \/>My least favorite thing about this dock is the price: at $300 (as of Dec 18, 2022), it is priced on the higher end of similar docks. Still a great dock, just an expensive one."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"charging ports break after exposed to weather for a while","text":"So I owned two of these cameras (argus eco).  They work okay - miss a lot of events but that was not the biggest problem.  I had both charging continuously with a solar panel.  For some reason I had to take them in at some point because they were not charging.  Reolink support recommended charging them indoors with the usb.  Each of the two times I did that, the charging port sunk so far into the camera that I could not connect it.  After dealing with this for a while with Reolink support, the bottom line was that since it was out of warranty, there was nothing they could do. By the way, one of these was a replacement camera they sent (for a different issued) that was only  6 months old but they do not count the warranty from that, they count it from the original purchase date.  So this happened on a camera that was only 6 months old as well as one that was a little over two years old.<br \/><br \/>Since I could not charge the camera, it was not usable so I decided to take it apart to see what the issue was.  The pictures show that the connection port is thinly attached to a computer board.  The computer board is held in place (pushing the port up through the connection hole), simply with tape.  So the tape dried out and now slides down (see pictures), taking the port with it when you try to plug in.  This is a ridiculously simple problem to solve by the company.  They should simply screw in the board to the part that holds it in place.  So now I have two cameras that should work (well, one I destroyed by opening it up) but don't because there is no way to charge it.  Also, the soldering that connects the port to the board is also very weak.  It super easily broke off when trying to fish it out with tweezers.<br \/><br \/>So, I might be stupid in that I ordered two more reolink outdoor cameras (a different type this time).  If the charging ports are built the same, I expect to have the same problem in the future.  Then this will truly be the last outdoor reolink camera that I will ever purchase.  The only reason I stuck with it is because it offers local storage.  I have no interest in paying for a subscription or having my images on a cloud...although I will likely reconsider that if these two new cameras fail as well.<br \/><br \/>To those of you that have not yet run into this problem, maybe try to find a way to secure the porrt now, before you lose it to drying out tape."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Best USB hub I've tried so far","text":"Love this hub. Lots of performance, lots of flexibility. You don't need external power for this hub, unless you want it; in which case you need to provide your own power source (there is a USB-C port on the side that you can plug the power source into). If you are going to be using this hub for everyday devices (flash drives, mouse\/keyboard, etc.), you don't need external power anyway.<br \/><br \/>Having 7 (!) expansion USB 3.2 ports sitting on your desk is a game changer. Much easier than plugging directly into your computer. The high transfer speed is SO nice. Most (newer) PCs only have 1 or 2 USB 3.2 ports, so getting 7 with this hub is awesome.<br \/><br \/>It seems like a selling point for this hub is the 32 degree angle that it sits at, which at first I didn't think would be a big deal at first, but it is definitely better than a lay-flat hub (i.e., every other hub I've had). Makes it quite easy to plug in\/out of.<br \/><br \/>The only thing I'd wish for is faster charging (even with external power plugged in, it's not very fast).<br \/><br \/>Bottom line: a great hub."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Cool solidly built notebook; amazing graphics; nimble to the touch; a bit heavy","text":"See BUYER BEWARE NOTICE at the bottom of this review.<br \/><br \/>This is one impressive, sleekly designed, well-built notebook with a bit of a \"cool\" factor. The resolution and color vibrancy is amazing for gaming, movies, pictures, etc.  The 15.6 inch (viewing region of 17 inch screen) touch screen is responsive.  The red backlighting on the keyboard and speakers is cool. At almost 5 pounds (4 lbs. 11.9 ounces), this notebook is heavy.<br \/><br \/>After the system is set up, startup is practically instantaneous. Setup takes a little bit because the system has to be personalized (although some of the personalization can be skipped) and a Microsoft account has to be created. I had to temporarily turn off the MAC address filtering on my router because the MAC address of the wireless NIC is not supplied on the setup card that comes with the notebook.  I could have used the supplied USB Ethernet Adapter but then I would have been tethered to my router and its location.<br \/><br \/>During setup, I had to check email on another device to verify my email account and get a security code. I'm not sure how this would be accomplished without having a second device (such as a Smartphone) with which to check email, authenticate your account, and retrieve the security code needed to finish setup.<br \/><br \/>After creating a Microsoft account, I was ready to use this notebook. One month's free subscription to McAffee \"Virusware\" is included.  Additional setup is recommended for OneDrive and some personalization settings for McAffee.<br \/><br \/>OneDrive is your cloud storage for pictures, PC settings, and new documents.  These items are backed up to the cloud (to OneDrive) by default so that they can be retrieved from any device if something happens to the laptop. However, that only works if those features were set up and the documents library was added during setup. Apparently, there's a way to turn off cloud backup if one so chooses after setup, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.<br \/><br \/>The game graphics are stunning and the keyboard responsive. I was amazed at the vibrant colors shown in my flower photographs which were never visible on any other devices I viewed them on previously.  The quality of the sound is pretty good; although I wish it were louder when watching movies.  I did try to pair my [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] with this notebook using Bluetooth and it paired but no sound would emanate at all from that speaker.  I believe this is a problem with the Rock Out speaker and not the notebook.<br \/><br \/>These are the few negatives that I discovered when using this Omen notebook.<br \/>- The function keys not easily seen. The Fx notations are so small but it really does not matter much because I am familiar with where all function keys are located.<br \/>- All four UBS ports are in the back of the unit. The power cord interferes with one of the USB ports. When I plugged in a mouse to the port next to the power cord, I had to swivel the cord until I could get the mouse cable to seat correctly.<br \/>- The audio is pretty good but not great.<br \/>- A fully charged battery lasts less than 2 hours on the HP recommended setting (not the Power Saver mode). For me it lasted 1 hour 35 minutes and then I got a warning that it was very low.  I had about 10 more minutes left on my battery when I checked it.<br \/>- The screen only has 15.6\" of viewing capacity<br \/>- The notebook is heavy at almost 5 pounds (4 lbs. 11.9 ounces)<br \/><br \/>Based on the setup information, the notepad I received came with:<br \/>- 462GB (only 426 GB are free at delivery)<br \/>- 16.0 GB RAM<br \/>- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.50 GHz Processor<br \/>64-bit OS x64-based processor<br \/>- Full Windows Touch Support with 10 Touch Points<br \/>-Windows 8.1<br \/>- Generic PnP Monitor (Intel (R) HD Graphics 4600 (GeForce 333.55 Driver)<br \/>- Resolution 1920x1080 recommended<br \/>- It also has a Webcam, SD memory card reader, and HP Omen programmable gaming keys.<br \/><br \/>Despite its heft, limited battery power, good but not great audio, and the location of the USB ports in the back, I still feel this notebook is a great contender for gaming, movies, pictures, etc. It also comes with a one-year limited warranty.<br \/><br \/>BUYER BEWARE: The specifications on Amazon do not match the notebook I received although the model number was the same on the box (#15-5010nr).  HP has several options available for the OMEN. Unfortunately, I've been unable to find a comparison chart on the differences on their website.  If you order this one on Amazon, you will most likely get a notebook with 256 GB hard drive and 8 GB RAM instead of the 462 GB hard drive and 16 GB of RAM I received. As of this writing, it appears that you will not even be able to buy the model Vine reviewers received on Amazon. My review is for the notebook I received which is the HP OMEN Notebook Model 15t-5000 CTO Model:K7N95A5.  Thanks to another reviewer in pointing this out."}

The hub requires power, so a big thin-corded AC power supply adapter is included.  The 1-meter cable has a USB-C (reversible) connector on one end and a Micro-B 3.1 connector on the other.  The USB-C connector goes into the computer\u2019s port; the Micro-B connector goes into the hub\u2019s port.<br \/><br \/>The hub has a metal exterior, is attractive, has a small footprint, and seems to be generally well made.  However, it does NOT seem to have a light that tells you when it\u2019s connected, powered, and ready for use.<br \/><br \/>In my experience, Belkin products perform exactly as advertised.  However, at the current price (about $90 on Amazon), this hub seems expensive for what it is.  I rate it at 4 stars (\u201cI like it\u201d on the official Amazon scale)."}

I think it is probably overkill for our home wifi which runs 80Mbs.  Drivers installed and I was on the wifi within 10 minutes.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"A Nice Basic Jelly Case","text":"I like this case.  It is just a simple, snug fitting, rubber armored feeling case. It doesn't have man whistles and bells, although I am happy they threw in a bonus screen protector and cleaning cloth.  I wasn't looking for much, just a little more protection for our iPod 5th Gen.  It does seem like it will help kid proof it in several ways.  First, the rubbery finish is grippy and makes it a little harder to have it slip from your fingers.  Also it protects the camera bump that has always seemed a little exposed,  I am glad that it now seems recessed.<br \/><br \/>I like the classy smoky gray look although it kind of takes away from the fact that the blue back was specially chosen, but I'll take the scratch protection over being able to see the blue.  Also, I like the thinness of the iPod and this case doesn't add that much bulk<br \/><br \/>I'm giving it 4 stars because it is pretty basic and doesn't blow me out of the water, but I am very happy with it. I would recommend it for a simple scratch resistant cover."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Breathtaking Display; Requires Graphics That Can Handle Native 3840 x 2160 Resolution","text":"After a month, this LG ELECTRONICS 4K UHD 27UD88-W LED-LIT MONITOR still takes my breath away.  I\u2019m not a gamer or a professional photographer, but I still can appreciate having crystal-clear resolution and stunning color for everything on my desktop.  The extra width (27\u201d diagonal) means the desktop itself is huge, even when the display is set to show text, apps, and other items at 200%, as I prefer.  (If I use the included Split Screen 2.0 app, which makes full use of the 3840 x 2160 native resolution--using tiny icons and text, and offering multiple options for 2 or more split screens--there is an incredible amount of desktop workspace available.)<br \/><br \/>The one snag that I ran into, is that the on-board graphics in my 3-year-old ASUS computer (running Windows 10) were NOT capable of displaying the 3840 x 2160  native resolution.  This meant that the monitor would not display my Windows desktop until I purchased and installed a new graphics card.  My card is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 (in stock at Best Buy in the gaming section).<br \/><br \/>Any of the following graphics cards will work, with either a DisplayPort or HDMI connection.  For Windows OS:  (1) the Intel HD4600 or higher; (2) the AMD HD7000 or higher,  the AMD R7 or Higher, or the AMD FireProW600 or higher; or  (3) the NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 or higher, the NVIDIA Quadro K500 or higher, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX960 or higher.  For Mac OS:  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, early 2015); MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, mid 2014); Mac Pro (late 2013); iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, late 2014 and after); MacBook Air (early 2015).<br \/><br \/>The monitor worked with the drivers that came with the NVIDIA card, but had a barely visible flicker.  Installing the drivers that came with the LG monitor itself corrected the flicker and resulted in the beautiful display that I love.<br \/><br \/>The monitor's simple, elegant design is also worthy of comment.  The stand is rock-solid, and the curved base not only looks great but takes up little space on a table or whatever you have it resting on.  The flat display screen is adjustable to many, many angles.  Because the stand is so well thought out, this very large, very wide monitor seems to use only a little more space than the AOC 24&#34; widescreen monitor that it replaced."}

Don't give up - pressing firmly.  Then, you should know that one size may work for one ear and another size the other.  I do have a bit of a problem keeping this in - but it's not the foam tip fault.  They keep them fairly short so they fit in the mini charger box.  I really need a longer foam tip to keep them in my ear.  I'm back to using my corded ear phones most of the time - it's a real shame because these would be so convenient in size.  Of all the foam tips, these were the best - they are not quite long enough to help me.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."}

They are actually imprinted InTo the wooden disc (making these permanent and eliminating scratching off paint..) The discs are double sided which cuts down on storage- and that\u2019s always a bonus..<br \/><br \/>I gave these as a gift to first time parents and it\u2019s perfect.. 1st timers tend to always be better record keepers and have ability to mark each of these memorable occasion- bc, they\u2019ve yet to become outnumbered by mini people!!<br \/>The sex of the baby is unknown so, I love these  are unisex ... and if, they have more children in the future- they could use these again.. and again!!<br \/><br \/>The only reason I deducted a star was due to the choice of color used in the imprint of the wood itself.. Goldish??? Tbh, at different angles- it can be difficult to read.. And this is one thing you just don\u2019t want or need to fuss with- when trying to pose an infant\/toddler who\u2019s less then, cooperative at best in photo shoots..!!!  I\u2019m sure these would be most legible in black ink- AnD not in a font that is swoopy cursive either.. A playful\/juvenile\/bold font would be much easier to read.. and maybe more inline for a babies just the same?! With both, the gold + cursive- you need to catch the disc at just the right angle to see\/read lettering.. Otherwise, it can blend into wood making it hard to decipher.<br \/>I DO suggest placing these on a brightly colored backdrop\/blanket.. that will help color to pop!<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is such a fun\/cleaver gift for parents to receive- it could be used for multiple children, no problem. This set could even be shared with friends and family that are also in the baby phase of life!! (us mama\u2019s love to loan our baby gadgets and help one another out..) I am certain, ordered one would definitely get a lot of mileage out of this!"}

I was able to figure out how to use it on my own which says a lot.  Prior to using Arlo Pro system, we have tried a no-name brand camera that worked so-so and most recently, my husband had been using our old cell phones (that did not work as phones any longer, but the cameras still worked). We are so impressed with how well these work. The images that we view on our cell phones are very clear. Since we have two cameras, it's a split screen on the phone so we can see both cameras at the same time. We have a couple of cats and a dog, so we have turned off the motion sensors for now. We were getting email notifications a little too frequently. The two way sound works as it should - we could see that coming in handy with the pets when we are away. The images aren't live when we first go to the app, but it doesn't take long to get the live images. The pets weren't too happy with the siren feature, but it is a nice feature to have.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good substitute for a mouse that limits the arm movement and a mouse pad that a mouse requires","text":"Back in the late 1980's and early 1990's I was hooked on a Kensington trackball. I always hated having to move my mouse around and  found those big trackballs that felt like a cue ball in the hand to be so much more comfortable, responsive, and easier to use.<br \/><br \/>This trackball mouse is sort of a spin-off on that, even though it is not all trackball. It did take me a few hours to get use to this because I have to operate the ball with my thumb. Drag and drop is still a mystery to me. After a while I was able to do that two times but then could not seem to do it again. Instead cut and paste is easier until I can figure this out.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, this works as designed. The trackball, which is operated with the right thumb (not sure what left hand people do) is supremely responsive--perhaps too much so. However, I did notice that after a selection (like a cut and paste), it does take a moment for the trackball to respond. I assume that is to be expected.<br \/><br \/>This is ergonomically designed and feels great in my hands and during operation. I like that I no longer have to use a mouse pad although I do wish I could figure out the drag and drop.<br \/><br \/>The only negative related to this hardware is that it is very difficult to get into the battery compartment. One really has to have long nails to wedge into the groove to open the cover. It takes one AA battery.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this type of trackball mouse is helpful to people who have hand or wrist problems. It is designed for a right-handed person. The unit is larger than a regular mouse but does not require a mouse pad. There can be a steep learning curve related to operating one of these as I am currently discovering. Overall, I like this; I just wish they would make the battery cover easier to get into."}

Note that an oval Type-C plug looks like a hollow lightning cable plug (see the illustration of the port and plug in the product page photo).<br \/><br \/>There are NO safe adapters available that convert a standard, rectangular USB Type-A plug to a Type-C plug, so you must have one of the still fairly uncommon Type-C ports to be able to use this hub.  (The available Type-A to Type-C adapters do NOT meet industry specifications, and pose significant danger of starting fires.)<br \/><br \/>I\u2019m a big fan of Sabrent products, because they\u2019re affordably priced and always perform exactly as promised.

I'm super sad there is no disk drive!! I feel like if i pay over hundreds for a laptop I should not have to buy an external disk drive to use CDs. Some classes have discs to use or install software, super inconvenient with that. It is a little glitchy and slow if you're clicking around too fast, ect.

Out of all the brands I have used, they seem the best.  I only use 3 brands now: Sony, HP or Verbatim.  I would buy Sony again anytime.  Note that every brand I have tried fails if I go above the minimum burn speed.  Could be my old slow hardware that causes the problem with not being able to burn at higher speeds.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Missing needed SD Card; no cord for attachment to computer; poorly written manual; doesn't appear to ever completely charge up","text":"When I got this, I assumed it was a complete operable unit, but apparently you have to buy an SD card to go with it, which I did not know.  You would think they would include the card, since the unit is useless without it.  I was able to buy a card for around $8 on sale, but they usually are not that cheap.  The unit has a nice bright, clear display screen, so the optics seem to be quite good.  Also it comes with a nice long cord to use in your vehicle, so if your accessory adapter is not near this, the cord will most likely reach.  The included manual is very poorly organized and is not written in the best English.  Also, certain icons that show on the screen are not even explained in the manual.  It seems as if the manual is out-of-date with updates that may have occurred in the device software.  I could not find a newer manual on the website; in fact could not find any information on the website about this device.  For some reason, the indicator that the device is charging never seemed to indicate that charging was complete, even when I left it plugged in overnight on my computer.  As soon as I unplug it from the car or the computer, it will no longer function, so maybe I got one with a defective battery?  They also do not include the USB cord for hooking the device to your computer.  There are several types of USB cables and the end that goes into the camera is small, so you need that specific size.  Fortunately I had a spare that fit.  Somewhat disappointed in this device so far and even though I charge it for hours, it won't come on unless it is attached to the computer or the car (with the car on). The setup menus are easy to use and not difficult to figure out, although the manual is not that helpful. I might actually use it out the back window of the car, since I had rather record what is going on behind me than in front.  Luckily my van has an accessory outlet in the back, as well as the front.  Meanwhile I just want people to realize you don't get a complete package when you buy this.  You have to buy an SD card and if you want to save any video it makes, you need a USB cord that fits it.  Note that the unit can also function as a digital camera too, but I was unable get it to work without being attached to the computer or the car, since the battery never seems to charge up.  It has been several days since I contacted the company with a question about the charging and no response in several days.  I noticed that if your unit has a problem, on the website it says they charge a $40 handling charge for you to send it in and get it repaired or replaced.  That seems outrageous to me."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Wow! This equals parent of the year award..!!","text":"Ordered this for my son and his 17th birthday!! Chose this specifically because of the subwoofers and boy, you would\u2019ve thought we had purchased an entire home stereo system\u2026 He was over the moon happiest with this gift- and mind you, he also received a new PS4 gaming station!!<br \/><br \/>I was apprehensive how well the sub would sound in a small Bluetooth speaker and truly, it suits the needs we have perfectly. Those needs being\u2026 \u201cI\u2019m 17 with a few friends over (ha! Must remember we\u2019re in the middle of COVID-19..!!) and we want to turn up music in my room, take the music to the pool\u2026 Or, just tell people we have our very own subwoofer! Sad but true, it\u2019s all about bragging rights at this age\u2026 If this is any indication of the coolness factor, I\u2019ve had two parents contact me asking what exactly was purchased to make us the coolest parents of the year!! That is The best endorsement I need.<br \/>As for functionality, I\u2019m impressed the sound quality can turn an adequate size living room into a rave, mosh pit, country jamboree\u2026 Whatever your poison is- this speaker does not distort at the higher volume, which I was concerned about. The fact the music of choice happens to be mostly rap is another story\u2026 but, that is not the speakers fault it\u2019s my sons poor taste in music!<br \/>As you can tell I am not a stereo guru or techie nope! Not in any capacity\u2026 I do know you can enter an SD card which was pretty impressive to the kids\u2026 I know they can lay tracks if that makes anyone feel better? Personally, I just made certain that had nothing to do with using drugs- and when I was assured it clearly wasn\u2019t\u2026 I let them do their thing!<br \/>Great idea I want to toss out\u2026 We also chose a Bluetooth microphone that runs about the same price as the speaker- And.. as the kids listen to music they can karaoke of sorts\u2026 Using a lot of fun features the microphone has (Voice distortion, echo, voice enhancing.. truly the ability to make anyone sound better than they do!) I mention this because, together these two items have created such a fun source of entertainment for the small crowd\u2026 And during the quarantine I will take it all day long!<br \/>At night- my son plugs in the speaker so it\u2019s fully charged and they have used it for a few hours at a time without any issue a battery\u2018s dying\u2026 Note, if next to an outlet you could also keep speaker plugged in and use it just the same. Technically, if plugged in this could run 24\/7- but, not sure you want to torture yourself that way!?<br \/>I will admit, this does remind me a little bit of my old high school days in the 80\u2019s.. when we would carry around a \u201cboom box\u201d on our shoulder- yep! You never knew when you needed to have a break dancing riff-off..!! The only thing different is, this Bluetooth speaker is half the size! Looks the same but a mini me version..<br \/>If looking for something to listen to that produces decent sound quality and definitely gets a throaty base this is it! Kids will appreciate it parents be warned-<br \/>I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!"}

There is a zoom on the left side of the lense: love it since we noticed the zoom function is a lot smoother than when using the usual zoom button;<br \/>3. Quality of pictures were very sharp even when using the zoom to its max.  Especially with a blue sly backdrop, we were amazed with the contrast of the subject matter.<br \/>4. Video was less impressive, could be quite grainy when using the zoom to the max:<br \/>5. The screen dispaly has a feature where it can extend such that when you are taking a picture\/video of a subject high up, it permits your head to stay level without over craning your neck!  A plus.  Or if you want to take a picture over a crowd!<br \/>6. Certainly a great camera for the price and we looked at the Sony at the time and it couldn't compete with the design and features. Great step up for someone who had a point and shot!<br \/><br \/>Con:  just one for us, we found the view of the subject matter on the display and what was actually taken was a little off and we had to comepensate for it when we were taking apicture.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Does a better job than cheaper antennas","text":"Previously I had purchased a cheaper antenna that was not powered, as this one is.  It worked pretty well and got quite a few channels.  This one, however, works better and a few more channels come in clearly and consistently.  I tried it too without the USB power and it still works well, but without the power, not all the channels came in.  For the little extra that this costs over cheaper antennas, it is worth it.  The long cord on it is a wonderful plus, as you can position it quite a distance from the TV, unlike cheaper antennas that may have shorter cords.  The only thing I can see wrong with this is that since it is powered, it does use some electricity, whereas cheaper antennas don't.  Probably not really much electricity, but as we add more and more devices to our homes, those energy vampires can add up.  I suggest trying it with and without the power.  If you don't use the TV every day, unplug the power.  If you have pets that tend to chew things, watch out for them with the long cords on this.  Very satisfied with it and may get another one for other televisions in the house, once we cut off cable, which we are doing soon.  You recover your cost of the device with just one month of cable.  Extremely easy to install--under 5 minutes."}

A combination that is apparently NOT such an easy thing to do.  My ears are not large, but not super small.  I just find that these are the most comfortable. As they warm with your body heat, they make the perfect fit.  They maybe aren't rocket science, super dooper cool ear buds, but if you want ear buds that are comfortable and work longer than 2 months, these are it! I'd give them 5 stars if they had a retractable case or similar."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"A rocky start but finally got it to work","text":"Unfortunately the wireless network drivers for this laptop did not work out do the box. I'd be able to connect to router only for it to crash a few seconds later, rebooted over and over with the same thing happening. There is no eithernet plugin for this laptop as it is very thin. I think they still could of added one but maybe they were trying to cut cost and weight. I have a USB to eithernet so I was able to use that and the serial number on the back to access the latest wireless drivers on the dell site. After updating and rebooting I had no more issues with the wireless network card. If you don't have a USB to eithernet adapter you'll need a USB flash drive and another computer to get the updated drivers to this system.<br \/><br \/>After the hour of troubleshooting and fixing the issue I was able to finally test the system. I had no issues installing all my core software apps MS office, Adobe PS CS5, Adobe Acrobate, and other misc apps. Hard drive seems to be a bit small but everything has gone cloud these days so I don't really see a need for a larger hard drive. Graphics are quite good. As good if not better than my work laptops that cost much more. Touch screen is accurate but I really don't think I could ever use this as a tablet as I'm not very impressed with MS OS for tablet use. Over all a solid 4 start laptop (5 if I hadn't had the wireless NIC issues) if you can find for $450. Currently selling for $499. And I think that is just a bit hig. A very nice light option that will work nicely for most laptop users."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Dead spots are gone.","text":"This wireless range extender was fairly easy to install.  The directions were straight forward, and the device was up and running in less than fifteen minutes.  It comes with an CD, but we didn't have to use it.  We did have to reset the IP address on the computer, but that may have a user issue and not related to the device itself.<br \/><br \/>It took a little while to find the best place to plug the device in based on our home's layout, but we found one that worked.  In our house plan, the best place ended up being in the hallway at baseboard level.  Fortunately, the device is small and plugs straight into the wall, eliminating any unsightly cords.  It would have been nicer to have the device a little more out of the way.  We were a little concerned about this thinking it might get kicked or knocked by the kids as they race around and play. That hasn't happened yet, but it is something to take into consideration if you have small children or pets around.  We tried placing it in a less open area hoping to protect it a little more, but none of those areas produced a satisfactory result.<br \/><br \/>It's very easy to tell how much of a signal the device is receiving from the main router.  Three bars is full signal, and one is low signal. The signal indicator light is easy to read and is quite bright.  Since the device is in our hallway, it acts as a nice night light and would be rather distracting if it were in a bedroom.<br \/><br \/>The end result:  the dead spots are gone.  We can use all of our devices in the those areas without having to worry about losing a signal."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Won't Stream DRM-Protected Commercial Movies, But Transfers All Other Content Nearly Effortlessly","text":"In my experience, wireless storage drives are bulky, extremely difficult to set up, and not worth the effort because they won't stream purchased movies (because of DRM protection).  But this SANDISK CONNECT WIRELESS STICK is totally different!  It's about the size of a lipstick, is extremely easy to set up (using the Android or iOS \"SanDisk Connect\" app), and it (finally!) provides a simple way to transfer files (photos, music, videos, or documents) onto or off of tablets and cellphones.  It still won't stream DRM-protected movies, but it does everything else you'd want a mobile wireless storage drive to do.<br \/><br \/>Once it's charged, and powered on, the SanDisk Connect Stick broadcasts a network signal.  You then connect your mobile device to the Connect Stick's network, and open the SanDisk Connect app.  And that's it.  The app allows you to back up your Photo Gallery or Camera Roll (automatically or selectively, with or without deleting backed-up files), and allows you to transfer music, video, and document files between your mobile device and your Connect Stick (in either direction, either to or from).  If you want to connect to the Internet while the Connect Stick is in use, the app has a \"pass through\" feature that will let you connect to the Internet via your home network, without disconnecting the Connect Stick.<br \/><br \/>The only problem I encountered was in trying to connect my PC wirelessly to the Connect Stick.  You must connect the PC to the Connect Stick's network, then use a browser to go to the SanDisk Connect web site and open a display that looks like the Android or iOS app.  This procedure worked for me only some of the time, and then only with the Google Chrome and MSIE browsers (never with the Firefox browser).  So I would recommend setting the SanDisk Connect Stick up with a mobile app before you even attempt connecting wirelessly to a PC or Mac.<br \/><br \/>Of course, there is absolutely NO need to connect a PC or Mac to the Connect Stick wirelessly--because you can transfer your files to and from the Connect Stick directly by plugging it into a USB port on the computer.  When you do that, the SanDisk Connect Stick works just like any other flash storage drive.<br \/><br \/>The SanDisk Connect Stick charges by being plugged into a computer's USB outlet, or into an AC wall adapter for USB.  It cannot be charged with a USB cable.  It takes about 2 hours for a full charge, and it transfers many, many files before needing to be recharged.<br \/><br \/>This is the wireless storage drive that I've been waiting for!  With it, I can effortlessly transfer content (particularly photos and videos created with my tablet or cellphone cameras) directly from my mobile devices.  No longer do I have to email photos or docs, simply to back them up so that they can be erased to clear space on the mobile device."}
{"rating":1.0,"title":"Annoying","text":"So I bought these as add ons meaning we already had a blink system. I checked to see if they were compatible and saw they were with no heads up on any other changes(other than remarkable battery improvements\ud83d\ude44) I can\u2019t tell you how they work because they changed the mount. So now you can only mount to a wall rather than a horizontal surface like your eves or soffit unless you just want to surveil the ground because of the awful range of motion of the mount. You could drill through your siding if you wish, but it sure would be better to drill through a $2 piece of soffit. The original bracket was no gem and I\u2019m sure they got plenty of complaints about the fact that you couldn\u2019t adjust that one in the wall mount config. Why not just supply both or better yet one that\u2019s engineered properly? I know they exist and aren\u2019t very expensive because I just bought a 3 pack of mounts for $18! Unbelievable. Maybe I\u2019ll update when my SECOND ORDER AREIVES so I can finish this project. And just expect to be changing batteries all the time unless your outdoor environment is actually a climate controlled testing area. Thanks a lot Amazon<br \/>Oh and they include a bracket extender to increase range of motion, but the picture is it\u2019s physical limit soooo unless the extender is magic it\u2019s still ridiculous."}

It was cool asking Siri to turn it on and off. I really wanted this for Echo and Alexa. Try as I might, I couldn't do it. I downloaded Wink and synced Alexa with Wink. And then synced IHome with Wink. Could not get Alexa to find the smart plug at all (and I spent hours today on and off trying to do this). I will try again tomorrow. However, I will tell you nothing is easy with this. I found no instructions for use with Alexa in the package and had to surf the web for solutions. Seems like a lot of work to be able to simply turn on a light with my phone. Also, I could not get Siri to do this remotely (while I was out and about), so I assume it only works if you are in the proximate area for programming. Seems expensive for what it really gives me."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great little camera","text":"Ultra compact cameras like this one don't take pictures as nice as SLRs, but the best camera is the one that you use and not the one that sits at home.  And with the size and weight of this Canon you'll use it everywhere.  Another huge consideration is LCD size.  Despite its small size the SD750 has a 3-inch LCD which is bright and crisp.  The size difference over a 2.5-inch LCD is a lot more than it sounds like because it's measured diagonally.  Definitely get a big LCD no matter what camera you buy.<br \/><br \/>As for photo quality, the SD750 is better than any other compact digital I've seen.  In full automatic mode under the right conditions (good light, stationary subjects, etc.) the photos are outstanding.  In less than perfect conditions if you want great shots you'll be well served to learn the controls and particularly the numerous scene modes.  My indoor shots in moderate light were coming out overexposed in the foreground and dark in the background, but once I started using the Indoor mode those shots looked great.  The Cloudy mode really helps bring out the colors in outdoor shots on cloudy days (as intended).  Take a little time to learn scene modes and other settings like High ISO and the different types of autofocus and you'll get much more out of this camera than if you just use full auto all the time.<br \/><br \/>As for special features, there are more on this camera than I would ever use.  Color swap modes, red eye reduction, slide shows and all kinds of stuff I'm sure I'll never touch.  I just want to take good pictures.  If I want to edit my pictures I'll do it on my computer and not in the camera.  But if that's your thing you'll be kept busy for a long time playing around with all the stuff the SD750 has to offer.<br \/><br \/>Finally, a great thing about the SD750 is the SPEED.  It's much faster starting up and taking shots than any other digital camera I've used.  From pressing the ON button to being ready to shoot takes less than a second.  Master the art of pre-focusing your shot by pressing the shutter button halfway and then framing your shot after it's focused and you'll virtually eliminate all shutter lag.  And oh yeah, the battery lasts a long time, though it would be nice if there was a battery indicator to tell you how much charge is left."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Decent headphones biggest drawback is distortion at moderately high volumes","text":"I'm pretty happy with these headphones, I received a reviewer pair intending to use them as my work headphones, and hope to make use of the sound canceling capabilities.  My previous head phones are [[ASIN:B002YOENAS Sennheiser  PXC 310 BT Compact Noise-Canceling Travel Headphones with Bluetooth Technology (Black)]] so that is what I am comparing them to.<br \/><br \/>Sound---<br \/><br \/>I am very happy with the clarity of the sound from these headphones.  The music is crisp and has decent highs and lows.  The one thing I am a little disappointed with is there seems to be a lot of distortion when turned to just a moderately high volume.  Which probably works well with my use at work, but I can't truly crank these headphones without  getting too much distortion.  Of course this is probably good for my hearing, but to continue the comparison to the Sennheisers, these have less capability at higher volumes.<br \/><br \/>When  listening to these at lower volume though, they are very nice.  I'm not a huge audiophile, but I can appreciate the sound quality these deliver.<br \/><br \/>Sound canceling appears to work fairly well.  I can at least attest to the fact that I missed phone calls while listening to these, I am interested to see how the will work to cut airplane noise.<br \/><br \/>Design ---<br \/><br \/>I'm impressed with the way these headphones have been designed to fold for storage and transport.  They are not as compact as my Sennheisers, but they do fold into a decent size and the nice leatherette case holds them well, with space to spare for extra accessories.  The ear pieces swivel well to form to you head, the cable connects firmly and securely, and the battery compartment is well designed.<br \/><br \/>Also, I am impressed that they thought to add an adapter for an airline headphone jack.  I am looking forward to having these to listen to on my next air trip.<br \/><br \/>Comfort---<br \/><br \/>The ear pieces are nicely padded that make a nice comfortable fit.  I have historically only used ear buds so at times my ears seem to get warm due to the coverage of the ear pieces.  The bar is padded but noticeable on your head, again for those used to earbuds this takes an adjustment.<br \/><br \/>Summary---<br \/><br \/>All in all these are nice headphones.  I prefer my Sennheisers which do deliver a little better sound on the corded connection (less sound quality over Bluetooth.)  However, I am happy with these, but not enough to justify the price savings over the Sennheisers."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Amazing Keyboard Cover","text":"This is the best keyboard I have found for the iPad, and I've used a lot of them. In terms of the usability and comfort of the keyboard itself, the quality is simply unmatched. My last keyboard had flimsy keys and would sometimes type 2 or 3 letters with one keystroke, while other keys didn't seem to work at all. This one is exactly the opposite - it feels great to type on even if it's a little undersized, and all the keys are exactly where you'd expect them to be. Having two shift keys is also quite nice, that's one of my main gripes with every other iPad keyboard.<br \/><br \/>The cover feature is also very good, though the hinge magnet does seem a little bit less \"snappy\" than the smart cover. It works fine, but it just seems a little bit lower quality. When closed, it blends perfectly with the iPad itself and creates a seamless brushed metal case all the way around, aside from the two ends of the slot that the iPad fits into during use. It is slightly thicker than the iPad 2. One thing this product has over many other keyboard covers is that you can use portrait mode, though as stated in other reviews, that position is not quite as steady as the magnet in the holding slot does not work in portrait orientation.<br \/><br \/>The battery life is also quite impressive. The manual claims 6 months (2 hrs\/day usage) on a single charge. I can attest to that since I've had it for several months and have yet to charge it a second time (although I use it probably an hour a day, if that).<br \/><br \/>The last point is the price. Having used it, I'm confident it's a good buy. Might be a bit on the expensive side, but you're getting your money's worth - it does not seem rinky-dink like a lot of these other keyboards. This is clearly a professional, high-quality product.<br \/><br \/>For me it's turned typing on the iPad from a headache\/nightmare into, basically, using a normal keyboard. I've seen a couple other reviews that complained about the protective edges getting in the way, but I keep my wrists up when I type so it's not a problem for me. The only thing I miss from a normal keyboard is a delete button (the 'delete' on this keyboard is backspace) and the home\/end keys. There may be a way to do those, but I haven't used it long enough to find out.<br \/><br \/>I'm a software developer with roughly 10 years of solid typing experience, and this is not just a great iPad keyboard, but in itself a very nice keyboard, period. I wouldn't mind having to use it on a normal computer. Overall, it's simply amazing. I typed this entire review with it and had no problems whatsoever. I highly recommend it."}

They had twenty radios for the boosters to use, but it was determined that they needed more to replace some that had gone missing or failed. Each radio has it's own charger. It comes with a programming cable so you can set up the frequency to use. They can all use the same frequency or as in the case of the boosters, we have different frequencies for different needs. It comes with software so you can program them, but my husband found a different program that worked better in his opinion. The radios work well, as expected."}

You will have to load the app and follow directions to bluetooth transfer pics you choose from your gallery to the frame.  I purchased an additional memory chip - but it turns out there is no place to install the chip so don't waste your time there.  You can set a regular time to 'run' the frame or manually turn it off and\/or on.  You can 'shuffle' OR play all your uploaded pics.  You do not get to choose the 'fade' that happens between pics, but you do get to choose how long each pic stays on the frame before moving to the next pic. Picture quality is pretty good - about as good as the pics you download on to it.  It's close to an 8x10 frame.  Not sure why they call it a 'touch screen' cause I can't figure out what you can do by touching the screen - but ok. It comes with charging cord, regular plug in - there appears to be a mini USB port, but I haven't tried it.  Having said all this I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful."}

I honestly don't need to &#34;see&#34; what it is that is tracking.  It is pretty compact, but as I have seen, effective.  It has a cig lighter plug in and fits firmly in it. I have owned several radar detectors over the years, some hundreds and hundreds of dollars and the ones I hold on to are the ones that cost a couple of 20's. Surprisingly, or maybe not so, the cheaper ones seem to last a LOT longer too.  The expensive ones didn't &#34;detect&#34; any more effectively and offered things I would never and did never use.  Just personal choice\/observation, everyone chooses for themselves. I will update with any wear or other issues."}

However, one of his monitors didn't have the VESA mount on the back, so he was unable to utilize it as intended. He decided to bring it home and set it up in his home office. He was only using two monitors at home, so he started by setting those up on the stand. Set up was okay - not too complicated, but not simple either, but he was able to do it on his own. He found a third monitor to add to it. Mounting the monitors wasn't difficult. It's impressive how secure the monitors are on the stand. In addition to freeing up space on the desk, he's finding that the cat doesn't block as much of the screen as he did when the monitors were on the desk."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Very nice size and it's weight is light to begin with!","text":"What I dislike if the carier itself is already weighed down with material before I even put anything in it.  This is so not the case for this camera backpack, very light indeed.<br \/><br \/>In total there are four compartments: one of either side, one on top and one on the front of the backpack.<br \/>1) right side pouch:  rather flat space that opens up with a side extension, really useful for camera cloth.  You can't make this bulge put as it would affect the storage of a tripod, see below.<br \/>2) left side pouch: more exciting space, it opens up to the main storage space of the bag where all the lenses are kept.  The compartments are adjustable.  In fact you can pull all the dividers out and you are left with a small pack back!<br \/>3) the top puch has a smaller zip opening to hold the body of the camera ( provided you don't pull out all the soft dividers, see above).  Also there is a small netted pouch that hold the 'poncho' for the backpack.  Very neat feature!<br \/>4) the front pouch opens up to a space for pens, books.  I think I will use this pouch to put my iPad, to down load pictures as additional storage and my small storage case for SD cards and spare batteries.  This is a good pouch for bit of wiring and filters too.  I know it's older sibling, 309, has storage for a laptop, but with the weight of everything, I think my iPad\/tablet is perfect!<br \/>To the side of the fold down front pouch is another zipped space for more flat items like travel documents.<br \/><br \/>Top right side there is a storage buckle that is to hold a tripod, with adjustable strap (carbon fibre tripod is the best choice as they are thin but built strong).<br \/><br \/>The backpack has one shoulder sling, seems odd, but it helps you rotate it to access the lenses without having to take the backpack off, place it on the floor, open in up..... Very clever feature indeed.  It takes a little practice to rotate, and change your camera lens, but I do like the feature, not clumsy at all.<br \/><br \/>For a starter camera backpack, this is pretty good with plenty of padding.  I love it.<br \/><br \/>The only think I wish it had was an external pouch to hold a bottle of water!"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Large aperture, nice bright images, but hard to clean","text":"Overall this is a nice affordable zoom lens.  The aperture is nice and big offering great light collection. Used with my Celestron astromaster 130EQ, it doesn't maintain focus across the entire zoom range, requiring about a quarter turn of focus adjustment from 8 mm to 24 mm.  And yes mine does rattle too.  There are four lenses total, and the spacers and mechanisms aren't well-matched.  But none of this really impacts the quality of the images.  I unscrewed it all and tightened it which helped some, but not much.  I use some basic eyeglass lens cleaning wipes which unfortunately introduced more lint than it removed.  The Eclipse cleaning solution works well combined with a lint-free pad.  The focal points across the range typically focus precisely on at least one of the lens surfaces.  Which means that any tiniest piece of lint or speck can foul an image, especially bright ones.  So be prepared for that, and if the internal lenses are clean and you're trying to fix a slight rattle by opening it up, my advice is don't!  This aside, the lenses themselves are good quality, and I'm pleased with the bright sharp images and large field of view I can get with this zoom lens for the price."}

Just note- sizes may not sound big when ordering but, I was surprised just how big 120 size screen really was!!! (Maths never been my strong point- so maybe this was just me.. but a quick size reference before ordering will give you some real time idea!)<br \/><br \/>Used indoors- we didn\u2019t need water weights.. but have if\/when necessary. Not sure how easy they\u2019ll be to use if using on a camp out\u2026 Water can be sparse- I\u2019d probably weight down with sandbag or cinder block?<br \/><br \/>If following instructions it\u2019s a bit contradicting to state\u2026 \u201cDo not fold or roll screen.\u201d To store in the provided carry bag- The only way to fit the screen in is to roll..?? Carefully doing so, we blindly followed and hoping it won\u2019t cause any issues- I wish it provided more clarity in this department!<br \/><br \/>As for screen itself.. just be sure to eliminate any light source from behind it since it can offset the picture from projector light on front side. Doing this gives a solid image\u2026 It\u2019s awesome! Used at our teen sons bday party with group of friends- we set up big screen in our game room and all had a solid view of movie marathon- zero complaints.. a huge node from a picky crowd!<br \/><br \/>Overall, as our 1st screen purchase.. it was so much better then using the wall or a sheet tacked up like we have! You cant believe how much it enhances the picture. I do wish screen protection was better and a few less pieces to build (capable for younger crowd to set up..) Otherwise, it\u2019s ideal.

First of all, Windows 10 comes with a camera application that this works good with.  Then I did a Facebook phone call with my sister, using the camera and it performed flawlessly.  The camera can either attach to the top of a computer screen or there is a nice tripod that comes with it that works well.  Just plug the camera into a USB port and you are ready to go.  Night lighting features for darker areas.  Bright white light that can be dimmed, a yellow softer light that can also be dimmed or if there is enough light, you don't need the light feature.  Even the USB cord was nice and long, so you can position it some distance from the computer.  I have no criticism of the camera at all, but the manual is in very tiny type, so a little hard to read for my old eyes.  Also, I could not figure out how to register the warranty.  They give you a card with a QR code to do the registration, but the QR code takes you to a Facebook Messenger page with a message that says: \"Get started\" and nothing else.

However, it looks like the product is just doubled so I guess I can give a pretty good review of the stand.  I work in IT so I have seen a lot of great and a lot of adequate stands in my career.  This one definitely falls in the adequate side. I set up a light 24 inch monitor on this arm and I don't think I would go any heavier.  It is not the best at holding its position and I don't think it would work at all with any screen with any weight.  It was fairly easy to install, pretty standard actually.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Compact, nice emergency radio with lots of features; 3 ways to charge and AAA battery backup","text":"I got this for two reasons: 1-To listen to AM radio and 2-To have a good emergency radio.  Probably won't use it much for listening to radio because the sound quality is very poor.  I couldn't get good reception from one of the strongest AM stations in my area.  FM seemed to come in much clearer.  I found one clear WB (weather band) station.  I wouldn't expect top quality sound, as the radio is quite small and compact.  As an emergency radio, this is excellent.  You can charge it with a manual crank, although it takes a LOT of cranking (no different than most radios that charge this way); a solar panel (which I haven't tried yet) or you can charge it from a USB connection. The USB cable is included for that.  If the internal lithium ION rechargeable battery should happen to die or become discharged, there is a compartment for 3 conventional AAA batteries.  There is a switch to use either the rechargeable battery or the AAA batteries (not included).  There are two lights on this radio.  When you raise the solar panel  there is a bright light that comes on.  There is also a light on the end of the radio, controlled with a push-button switch.  Other features:  has a button to turn on an alarm; has a headphone jack, has an external charging port for a USB device (such as your cellphone).  I like this little radio a lot and there is a lot of features packed into it.  The ONLY criticism I have is that both the tuning and the volume knobs don't turn very easily; they are very hard to turn.  That's why I knocked off one star on my otherwise 5-star rating."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Decent Non-Leather Case With Generic Bluetooth Keyboard; Fits Older iPad Air, iPad Pro Tablets","text":"+++EDIT (2\/10\/20):  The seller says that all the keys will work with an iPad, but you have to press Fn+E to convert to an iOS keyboard.  I couldn't test this, because I'd already disposed of the keyboard.+++<br \/><br \/>This EOSO IPAD KEYBOARD CASE FOR 2018, 2017 IPAD PRO 9.7; IPAD AIR 1, 2 (Slim Leather Folio Cover, Built-in Pencil Holder (9.7\", Black)) fits, and works with, my iPad Air 2 tablet.  However, it has a generic Bluetooth keyboard that is designed to work with Windows, Android, or iOS.  Thus it has keys that do NOT work at all with my iPad.<br \/><br \/>For example, the F2 key does NOT select text; and the F6 (fast-back) and F8 (fast-forward) keys barely work for advancing or replaying videos.  The F9\/F10 (decrease\/increase volume) and F11\/F12 (decrease\/increase brightness) keys do work as expected.  The Delete key at the top right does NOT work.<br \/><br \/>My iPad Air 2 paired easily with the bluetooth keyboard.  The folio case is slim and lightweight--a big plus for this item--but it is NOT a leather case.  It\u2019s made with some kind of textured fabric.  The case includes a silicone holder for the iPad Air 2, and the holder has a place to insert an iPencil.<br \/><br \/>The case unfolds to allow three different viewing angles.  This is good, but the keyboard must be removed from the case and placed in front of the iPad when the case is unfolded.  Removal is easy, as the keyboard is held inside the folio case by a strong magnet.<br \/><br \/>The price is very good, if you need a keyboard for your older iPad Air or iPad Pro 9.7\u201d tablet.  However, it\u2019s annoying to have a keyboard with keys that aren\u2019t functional.  Also, the square \u201cchiclet\u201d keys aren\u2019t particularly comfortable to type on.  The keyboard is very quiet to type on."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great value, great reception and clarity.  Tiny too!","text":"We paired this with three mobile devices: the iPhone (success), the blackberry touch (success) and the older version of HTC (failed).<br \/><br \/>Synching to the iPhone was the easiest of the three, where it just picked up the signal and away we go.  The blackberry took a few attempts, but it worked.  Our android HTC may be old, so I wouldn't want to rule out android phones I general.<br \/><br \/>The quality of the sound was fantastic (relative to the Bose Bluetooth headset).  It is tiny, but didn't seem to affect the reception of the  voice.  The hearing aspect was crystal clear.  It is so tiny and light, you forget you have it on your ear!  It has effectively three buttons: on-off; to end a call, and to mute the call. Volume is adjusted through your handset device.  Upon switching on the device, it tells you how many hours of talk time, and there is 6 hours for a fully charged headset.  In terms of range,  we could walk around our apartment from the phone without loosing the quality of the call.. (Just a little reminder for those new to this device that u don't have to walk with your phone).  It took less than one hour to fully charge.  It also comes with various ear pieces to fit your ear-hole, and if you prefer an over the ear piece, there are two such frames.  I only wished they came with a little case, like  the Bose, to hold the headset."}

If you're wondering how, it's easy (these are Windows Vista instructions - other operating systems may vary though all Windows systems are probably the same or similar):<br \/><br \/>First, turn off your computer.  Then connect the DVI jack on the cable to your computer's DVI output and the HDMI jack to an available HDMI input on your TV.  Use your TV's remote to select that HDMI input on your TV.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Keeps up to 15\" laptops elevated (and provides extra space) when using a wireless keyboard and mouse","text":"I have limited space on my breakfast nook and for the few times I work from home, I needed an option that would provide me with extra space so that I could add on a wireless keyboard and mouse and extra monitor without making it impossible to move.  This loft did the trick because it sturdily elevated my 15&#34; work laptop, allowing me space underneath to store the wireless keyboard\/mouse combo when not in use.<br \/><br \/>FEATURES:<br \/>- This is designed for most 11 \u2013 15 inch laptops. I do wish, however, it held larger laptops.<br \/>- It has a rubberized strip on both the bottom and top of the loft so that there's no slippage on the table or with the laptop.<br \/>- It is also easy to assemble by inserting the center clip and sliding each piece of the platform into the channel on the clip.<br \/>- It is also easy to disassemble. In fact, I consider it a bit too easy to disassemble. Since the top part of the loft comes off the moment it is handled, I do not recommend moving the loft with the laptop resting on top.<br \/><br \/>I tried this with the following three laptops:<br \/>- 15&#34; Dell Latitude E6430 (my work laptop)<br \/>- 17&#34; Dell Inspiron 1720 (not recommended, it was a bit too heavy for this laptop)<br \/>- 15.6&#34; HP Omen Laptop<br \/><br \/>According to the box, there's a 2-year limited warranty on this stand.<br \/><br \/>In general, I love this loft. It works perfectly for my 15&#34; work laptop which is what I got it for. Although I wish it did not come apart so easily, it remains sturdy when the laptop is resting on top and the easy dis-assembly is the price you pay for the ability to swiftly break this down for storage.<br \/><br \/>I attached a picture of this stand in use with my work laptop with the wireless keyboard and mouse attached."}

{"rating":2.0,"title":"Solid, well made, but some non-standard connectors and apparently no hotkey switching","text":"I was going to wait until I actually had truly tested and used this before I wrote a review.  I got this free as a review unit.  The problem is that I can't use it without spending some money for cables, as it does not come with cables.  StarTech says that's on purpose since people have different cable needs, especially different lengths. The cables that StarTech has available for it are over $21 each, which comes up to well over $60 for my 3 computers, almost the price of the switch.  With 4 computers connected, the price would be even more.  Okay, so they don't provide cables, but for the price of the switch, maybe they should at least give you a coupon or a voucher for one or two cables or a discount on the cables.  Interestingly the 2-port version does include cables; the 4-port does not.  StarTech's cables are nice, as they combine the needed USB with the VGA cable; otherwise you have to run two completely separate cables (one VGA cable for monitor and a USB cable for keyboard and mouse).  If you have USB cables as most people do, you can easily purchase the needed VGA cables inexpensively.  This brings me to the first real issue I have with this switch.  The master monitor connection is a female connector, which is standard.  Unfortunately the 4 computer monitor connectors are all male connections, so you can't use a standard male to male VGA cable that you would normally use from a computer to a monitor.  You have to get male to female VGA cables (which are typically called extension cables).  Why they would use this non-standard method of connecting monitors is puzzling.  A couple of reviewers were also concerned that this switch does not come with a power supply.  That's usually not a big deal as I found out that a power supply is not necessary, as the switch gets it's power from the USB connections.  There is no explanation as to why it has a place to plug in a power supply, although in some cases if you have a lot of USB devices connected to your PC, you might need additional power that a power supply would provide, so I assume it is for supplemental power.  It's good that they provide a way to add additional power, if you need it, even if not the actual power supply.  The next issue I encountered was trying to determine whether or not you could switch between computers with a hotkey sequence on your keyboard or whether you actually had to reach over to the switch and press the button for the computer you wanted.  Apparently there is no keyboard switching or if there is, no one seems to know what keys are used.  I read the manual for the setup and was concerned that it states that for PC to get the switch to work properly, a couple of BIOS settings for PC need to be changed.  I am not even sure that my computers have those particular settings, especially my older computers that sometimes have more limited BIOS settings available.  I have had 3 other KVM switches and none of them needed a change to BIOS settings.  Given the problems that others have had with this switch in that it doesn't always work flawlessly, I am not sure that I want to take time to test it right, since I already have a nicely working KVM switch.  I still have to buy cables.  On the plus side, this switch appears to be well built with a metal case; not cheap plastic.  It appears to be nice and solid and just heavy enough.  If the issues I mentioned are not a deal-breaker for you, I think this is worth trying.  I will update my review and add or subtract stars once I have a chance to test this in actual operation."}

All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source.

For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.\u00a0 I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including over 24,000 likes.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Seems to work some of the time","text":"Honestly I haven't had any calls that I would identify as scam calls since I installed this.  The problem is that I haven't been home a lot, so calls may be coming in and I am just not here to get them.  Of course I still get plenty of sales calls from somewhat legitimate companies from numbers that obviously aren't stored in the machine already.  When you receive a call, there is a BLOCK NOW button you can press to block the call in the future.  Unfortunately it only works about half the time.  Can't say that I have ever gotten \"#2\" from any of my phones to work, which is supposed to also block calls, as well as pushing the BLOCK NOW button.  The price is probably not worth it for a device that only partly solves the problem.  There are probably less expensive ways to deal with unwanted calls, although I don't have a good solution, which is why I got this device.  Granted my phone system is set up a little strange, so that could be part of the problem with this working as well as it could.  Also, the device needs a way to be updated to add more scam numbers as they are identified.  Seems to me that in a few years there could be many more numbers that aren't already stored in the unit.  The unit is a great idea, but it needs some work.  Probably works best with just one or two telephones, but I have phones all over the house; some are corded and some are cordless.  I have great hopes for the next model of this device if they make some good improvements.  Can't quite recommend it yet, unless you have an extreme problem with unwanted calls.  It probably will cut down on the unwanted calls, so might be worth it to get it, even if it helps only a little."}

A separate single sheet explains that AC switching power supplies can cause AM noise and recommends the radio be at least 1 foot from the power supply, which I did, but I couldn't detect any difference in the extra static using the AC adapter as a function of distance from the radio.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"These have great stereo sound and nice features but are not as comfortable as my Koss","text":"I own the [[ASIN:B00MVXUACM Koss SP330 On Ear Dynamic Headphones Black with Silver Accents]] (current price $105.52) and I love them because of their comfort, good sound, and overall quality.  I selected these headphones because I wanted to have a spare set and also to see how these would compare to my Koss.<br \/><br \/>I tried these headphones on the iPhone 5, iPad 3, and a Dell Latitude E6430 laptop and on all of these devices the sound was fabulous. It was actually more stereo sounding than my Koss.<br \/><br \/>PROS:<br \/><br \/>- The stereo sound is crisp and slightly better than my Koss.<br \/><br \/>- I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the electric blue color which is called \"candy blueberry.\"<br \/><br \/>- A headphone port on each earpiece provides the user with the ability to share the headphones by plugging in a music share cable which is NOT PROVIDED. A music share cable is not really needed in my opinion because all headphones come with one cable. While my boyfriend was listening to music on his iPad, I just plugged in my Koss cable to the side of the headset he was not using, and listened to the same music through my Koss headphones while he was using these.<br \/><br \/>- I like that the provided headphone cable can be used in the left or right earpiece which enables me to switch sides when I want.<br \/><br \/>- The headphone cable has an in-line MIC control for Android, tablets and other devices.  Based on my research, an in-line MIC means there's a built in microphone that is built into the cable which should enable the wearer to answer calls without removing the headphones. I was able to get this to work on my boyfriend's iPad and iPhone and he was able to talk and hear through the headphones.  There is a one button control on the in-line MIC which lowered the volume.<br \/><br \/>- The headphone band is adjustable.<br \/><br \/>CONS:<br \/><br \/>- The only CON I see is that they are not as comfortable for me as I would have liked. I used these a few times for a period of several hours. Even though they can be adjusted, I wound up getting a headache with extended use (more than 2 hours). So in this sense they were not as comfortable as they initially feel when just putting them on. The Koss headphones I own are the only ones I've ever tried that have been comfortable on me.<br \/><br \/>OTHER THINGS TO NOTE:<br \/><br \/>- The Amazon product page says that a music share cable is included; this is not correct nor is it really needed because if you are sharing just plug in a cable from another pair of headphones to the extra port on these.<br \/><br \/>- According to the manual, it takes 20 hours for the headphones to break in. It says the sound mellows out over time.<br \/><br \/>In summary, these headphones are great. They have fantastic stereo sound (at least to my ears), the ability to share by plugging in another set of headphones, and an in-line MIC. They are adjustable and relatively comfortable but not as comfortable as my Koss.  The color is also attractive."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Headphones","text":"These are good Bluetooth headphones. They are a little on the large side, but don't fully sit in the ear, so for most adults, they should be fine. They are a little big on me, but still usable without being uncomfortable. They sit pretty securely around the ear. The sound quality is good, but doesn't block outside sound, which is good if you are using these for running or areas where you kind of need to still be able to hear car horns and such. Really, the only problem I have with these is the battery life.They have to be charged daily, even if you don't use them. They just don't hold a charge as well as I would like. But just remember to charge them daily, and you're cool."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Good, but keeps revealing shortcomings","text":"Out of the box, this is a stunning piece of electronics.  The screen size is impressive as is the simplicity of the unit itself.  Turning it on it continued to be impressive. I charged it the required time and turned it on and it just kept on impressing.<br \/><br \/>However as I use it more and more, I find issues with the interface and unfortunately the car power adapter.  The first thing to end the honeymoon with this device was the fact that it kept telling me I was speeding.  Easy enough, I'll turn that off.  I navigated to the settings and turned this feature off.  But, at this point there was no submit option, just back.  So I could change the setting but never submit the change.  This frustrated me and my human navigator till we turned it off.  Later we found that we could turn it off, but not during it's active navigation.<br \/><br \/>Otherwise it is very feature rich.  I am impressed how easily I can find any address in the state and beyond. The turn by turn works well and it has helped me find several homes and businesses I was unfamiliar with.<br \/><br \/>But about 6 weeks into using the device it blipped off and would not restart.  It took some troubleshooting but I tracked it down to the power cord.  It will still charge with the AC adapter but the car adapter cord is shot.  This severely limits the functionality of the device since the on board battery last barely 30 minutes.  I have been reduced to using an AC inverter to get it to work on longer trips. The cable not working is a major bummer, but better than when I thought the entire unit fried.<br \/><br \/>But all in all I do like the basic functionality of the GPS. I don't know that I can go without a turn by turn GPS from here on out.<br \/><br \/>OK, I guess one more beef I have to give.  I, like 10% of all males, have partial color blindness, and the green from the proper road is very hard to distiguish from the beige of the other roads.  I am told that it is pretty clear to others, but a little trickier for me."}

I\u2019ve seen less and more from other vendors.<br \/>- You can record to a micro SD card, not provide.<br \/>- Come with long 9.5 foot usb power cable.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>- Fisheye or wide angle lens may be good for capturing a large area but it also distorts the image.<br \/>- When zooming in with this camera the image is extremely washed out a pixalated. I may need to play around with it some more to figure out why. My connection is perfect and the setting was set at ultra HD. I see much better zoom in clarity with my Motorola (Hubble) and Canary cameras.<br \/>- I would prefer more cloud options. 1 day recording for $30 a year.<br \/>- Not a lot of mounting options. There is one flat bracket. I haven\u2019t check their site to see if they make a swivel bracket.<br \/><br \/>Overall all a good option if you need an extremely wide angle camera, and I\u2019m talking very extreme.

Specifically, the button steps are:  (1) press D from the Time screen to display Menu; (2) press C\/D to highlight Workout, then press A; (3) press C on the Measurement screen to start measuring; (4) press D while measuring to record a lap; (5) press C again to stop measuring; (6) press D while measuring to display Measure Menu screen; (7) press C\/D to highlight Stop Workout, then press A.  Did you get all that?<br \/><br \/>In several sessions, I have tried to record a walking workout, but I've been unable to successfully start and stop a single one.  Worse, when I connect the watch to my PC, and ask the app to upload my watch data, it always returns the message: &#34;There is no data to upload&#34;.  This is true even though the watch has been recording my steps, and I can see my step activity by pressing an entirely different, equally complex sequence of watch buttons.<br \/><br \/>Regarding the software\/app, my first mistake was to try to begin using the watch via the Android cellphone app.  The app works, but the Runsense software display is far more complete and easier to understand when you connect the watch and its cradle to a PC.<br \/><br \/>Maybe I'm spoiled, because I have a [[ASIN:B00GOGV314 Jawbone UP24]] that tracks my steps, sleep, times of activity and inactivity, weight, and workout times through an easy-to-use cellphone app that uploads data automatically whenever the phone is connected to a wireless or cellphone network.  My specific Jawbone model has been discontinued, but there are newer models that do everything mine does, and also track heart rate.  I'm sure that these newer models are equally easy to use.<br \/><br \/>GPS MAPPING FEATURE.  The reason I ordered this Epson Runsense watch, when I already owned a reliable activity tracker, was that I wanted the GPS feature that is supposed to map and calculate the routes and distances travelled in workouts.  However, the Runsense SF-110 can hardly ever locate a GPS signal for me, and repeatedly returns the message &#34;Failed&#34; .<br \/><br \/>The instructions say that the GPS feature requires being somewhere with no overhead obstructions--which I guess means you have to be outdoors.  However, when I go outdoors and press the buttons for &#34;GPS location&#34;,  the watch can't find a signal.  So no maps, no distances for me!  I do live in a hilly area, but my cellphone and tablets are always able to find GPS locations easily, even indoors.<br \/><br \/>TIME KEEPING.  The watch has a large, easy-to-read time display, and it keeps good time.  There is a button that lights up the time display when you press it.  The plastic watchband is attractive and has a gazillion little holes, so it will fit any size wrist without resizing.<br \/><br \/>BLUETOOTH PAIRING. The watch was easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone.<br \/><br \/>It is possible that my EPSON RUNSENSE SF-110 GPS WATCH\/ACTIVITY MONITOR is a defective lemon, given that I can't get the GPS or the data upload features to work.  However, even if those worked, I would still find the button-pushing sequences too complex to be useable on a daily basis.  Consequently, I rate this product at 1 star (&#34;I hate it&#34; on the official Amazon scale)."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Add to dorm packing list- hangs fairy lights perfectly!!","text":"This is a MUST have for college kids heading into the dorms!! Truly, the perfect size and amount for our task at hand- which is... Drumroll please, the official hanging of \u2018fairy lights\u2019 in the dorm room- just like every other girl in the college arena..!!!<br \/>Wow! These fairy lights can be found on campuses everywhere- and because kids string them along their wall perimeter- this set of cable clips is such a perfect solution- trust me on this one, if hanging these lights.. you will thank me later!<br \/><br \/>Moving our second daughter into her college dorm, it was just a given.. Fairy lights were as essential as a dorm fridge and college textbooks! Having hung these with the last 4yr with her older sister, we knew tape, tacks, nails, sticky putty all fail- BUT, mini cable clips are perfect.. they\u2019re easy to apply (and remove!) and can hold the skinny wire of a fairy light strand just fine!<br \/><br \/>Note: these do not want to fit larger size cable.. not, the cord that is found on a regular set of string lights. However, fairy lights come on the thinnest twine of wires twisted together and with the wire being extra delicate- this is the perfect solution to hold the fragile wires safely in place.. (These work so well, they could even be labeled and sold as such for the consumer!) Your cable or, wire must be little and thin to fit this clip- So, just make sure prior to doing your hanging job that the clip will fit your need!<br \/><br \/>Adhesive is two sided and comes separate from the clip itself (view photo, and you can see adhesive paper is separate in the box) Yes, this creates an extra step attaching the adhesive.. *Hack: we make up a few of these clips prior to starting the job, just to make the process go smoothly. 3M makes a quality adhesive and these stay in place for the entire year! Just know- be delicate when removing!! These do like to grab onto paint when taking down. Ha! We have outsmarted the system and placed these on the 4\u201d metal strip that acts as \u201cdorm crown molding\u201c in our daughters room.. I believe this is an added feature placed to protect the walls.. ha!! However on metal, these remove nicely- same with a smooth wood or, particleboard.<br \/><br \/>Sizing of clip is super small- and the entire kit has a tiny footprint- see attached photos as well.. the small, thin case holds the all inclusive kit of clips x40..!! I\u2019m LOVING the case- it keeps everything needed in one container and easily stores inside a desk drawer. Coming off dorm drop duty.. we used these to hang x3 strands of fairy lights using approx. 8 clips per strand @ 16ft. That leaves about 1\/3 of clips for any other need.<br \/><br \/>Price point is reasonable for the amount of clips received. This set is a good one to keep on hand and have ready when needed.. But, it should be on the dorm packing list for sure- you won\u2019t find a better set for the $..<br \/>I hope this info helps\u2026 Feel free to let me know!"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Fun Camera!","text":"My 19 year old daughter got an earlier model of the Instax when she was in high school. I'm guessing it was at least 4 years ago. All of her friends have one. It's pretty popular among teen girls. My daughter is in high school now and still likes using her Instax camera. She likes to decorate her room with the little pictures. She'll hang them on clothesline type display with mini clothespins. I thought she would like an updated model of it. She immediately noticed the addition of the selfie-mirror! She was quite pleased with that. I used it to take recent pictures of the cats for her dorm room. I have used one in the past, but it was always a matter of it being handed to me all ready to go.  I was able to figure out and operate it without any trouble, which if you knew me, that would mean a lot! We didn't really notice any difference in the picture quality. It may be something that she notices after more use. She likes this one enough that she's  planning on giving her older Instax to her 12 year old cousin."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Wait for a Gold Box special before ordering","text":"I am a little disappointed with the quality of this point and shoot. First, the pros are that it is light, attractive, small and easy to carry. Everything else, in my opinion, really revolves around what you get for the money. Quality of the pictures is just ok, I honestly think my Apple iphone takes better pictures (even in dimly lit areas). But for those people who want to take a lot of pictures on a trip and need memory card, then a camera would be a must have. Not crazy about the zoom capability, seems to definitely be less than advertised. As I mentioned, in low lighting camera stabilization seems low. Overall, if this was in a gold box deal for $99 I would jump on it for the name and durability of a Sony product. But not for $20-30 more than that. I think you can do better."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Easy to Use; Work Very Well","text":"These sleeves really work and they are big enough to comfortably accommodate at least 4 to 6 thick cables; maybe more thin cables.  At first I thought 20 inches (the length of the sleeves) seemed a little short, but since cables start and terminate at different points, anything longer might not work as the run distance would be too long and you might have to &#34;backtrack&#34; on a cable after it comes out the end.  I have masses of cables running everywhere and just one of these helped make things neater.  Now I need to use the other 3 in the package.  I might even buy a second package of 4 if I still have cables that need straightening up.  The nicest feature of these sleeves is that you don't have to feed the cables through them.  They unzip for the entire length and you just lay the cables into the sleeve and zip it up.  No need to disconnect cables.  This is a genius idea and I love it.  I have tried other methods to keep cables together, such as zip ties, but they don't work nearly as well as these."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Heavy","text":"I am on the short side (5'4\"), and this bag was pretty big on me. More specifically, the \"handle\" part on the top of the bag digs into my neck because it just hits me too high. (My husband is 5'7\" and he did not have this issue.) So, I either have to deal with the bag digging into my neck or loosen it quite a bit. I like wearing packs a bit tighter, but I just can't on this one.<br \/><br \/>It is heavy without anything in it. Lots of padding, which is great. Much of the padding in the middle compartment can be taken out if you aren't using it. (Or you can take it out with your stuff inside, should you need said stuff out of the bag, but still want some protection.) It has room for absolutely everything. I do wish there was a little more space in it for, say, snacks or extra drinks. Most of the space is used up in that middle compartment with all the camera and lens padded areas. There is very little room in the largest zippered area, but it is big enough for your laptop, tablet, or e-reader. The front pouch has room for your phone (padded), keys, glasses, pens, etc. There is one drink holder pocket on one side.<br \/><br \/>I like the protection for my expensive stuff. Plenty of places to put camera and accessories. I just wish it fit better and had room for practical items, not just the expensive toys."}
