{"rating":5.0,"title":"Superb - a Non-audiophiles Review","text":"I have to confess I am not an audiophile but Sennheiser is starting to change that.  A year ago I got [[ASIN:B002YOENAS Sennheiser  PXC 310 BT Compact Noise-Canceling Travel Headphones with Bluetooth Technology (Black)]] and I have fallen in love with them. When I got a chance to get a review pair for MM 450's I jumped.  These are ever bit as good as old ones and I can't wait to use them on a flight soon.<br \/><br \/>--Use: It is very easy to pair these to blue tooth devices. I mostly use these in conjunction with an iPod Touch.  In the evening I usually switch from speakers to headphones so as not to annoy the neighbors and the headphones take over immediately when I turn them on.  Also I enjoy being able to skip forward and backward in the playlists by tapping the buttons on the ear piece. I still have issues with missed phone calls, but I get absolutely no distractions when working with them on (short of a fire alarm.)<br \/><br \/>--Sound: The Sennheiser sound is better than any headphones I have ever had.  I'm not a big fan of base and at first I felt that they did not get loud enough, but now I appreciate that I cranked my headphones to get over room noise.  With the noise canceling this is not an issue.<br \/><br \/>--Design: I love the folding design.  they fold flat and fairly narrow and fit into its well designed carrying case well. The smaller ear muffs are not as hot as the full sized ones which is nice and fit comfortably on the head, although sometimes I feel a little twist due to the folding hinges.  But all in all they are well crafted and comfortable.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>--Great Sound<br \/>--Great Remote controls for my iPod<br \/>--A usable and classy carrying case for cables\/headphones<br \/>--Extreme ease of use<br \/>--Hard-wired cable works great<br \/>--Long lasting batter - rarely need to recharge<br \/>--Amazing folding design makes it fit into my computer bag very well<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>--I find little point to the talk through option<br \/>--Sometimes noise canceling cuts you off from the world a little too much<br \/>--Hard-wired cable seems proprietary so I'm afraid to lose it<br \/>--Makes it hard to live with cheaper headphones<br \/><br \/>I'm still not an audiophile, but Sennheiser has made it impossible for me to go back to my old cheap headphones.  You do get what you pay for, and these are worth the price."}

These bands are perforated, but the holes are very, very small.  I wish they were larger.  There are 10 bands, all different colors.  I mainly use my black band... but it's nice to have a wild color just for fun once in a while.  They feel like and look like a rubber or silicone\/or like material.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Laptop Is Always Ready to Go, When Dock Handles All Wired Peripherals","text":"This ELGATO THUNDERBOLT 2 DOCK allows you to use a single Thunderbolt cable to connect all of your wired peripherals (monitors, backup drives, headphones, etc.) to your Thunderbolt-capable Mac or PC.  The Elgato dock (priced about $230) costs quite a bit less than the [[ASIN:B00NAWCU7G Belkin Thunderbolt 2 Express HD Dock]] (about $300), but the Belkin dock ships with a longer Thunderbolt cable (3.3 ft. instead of 1.6 ft.), and seems to be more sturdily built.  Also, the Belkin dock is more attractive (to my eye), because it's designed to look like something more than just another desktop hub. The two docks have nearly identical footprints (the Elgato is about 1\/2\" shorter in length), and both are powered hubs.<br \/><br \/>The docks are substantially the same in type and number of ports.  In front, the Elgato has one stereo headphone port (stereo output), one mono microphone port (mono input), and one USB 3.0 port.  In back, the Elgato dock has two Thunderbolt 2 ports, one HDMI port, one Gigabit Ethernet port, and two USB 3.0 ports.  In front, the Belkin dock has one headphone\/microphone port (audio in\/out), and one USB 3.0 port.  In back, the Belkin dock has two Thunderbolt 2 ports, one HDMI port, one Gigabit Ethernet port, two USB 3.0 ports, and one headphone\/speaker port (audio out).  Both docks promise that you can daisy chain up to four additional Thunderbolt devices (five total); and that you can have dual displays  if you have a Thunderbolt monitor, by using a Thunderbolt port for that monitor and  the HDMI port for a second monitor.<br \/><br \/>With either dock, I can set up a desktop with all my wired peripherals, and have them instantly available to my MacBook Air (via the one Thunderbolt connection) whenever I have real work to do.  I just plug the laptop into the dock--I don't have to plug each peripheral into an appropriate laptop port, because the peripherals are already plugged into the dock.  If I want to travel somewhere with the MacBook Air, or just take it downstairs for checking email at breakfast, all I have to do is shut it down and disconnect the single Thunderbolt cable."}

Not realizing this item did NOT include the actual charging device as well as the adapter, made this complicated and in the end\u2026 Unusable for our needs. I studied photos very carefully and TBH, was under the impression this was actually connected to the Apple brand- by viewing the photographs. I realize the error of that assumption was mine, only I didn\u2019t see something specific stating adapter only! IF, this could be stated very clearly by the seller- I\u2019m sure it will help others with a similar error and ordering in the future.<br \/>Not realizing we replaced our Mac computers charge cord shortly after the initial purchase (puppy incident- chewed through it in told!) but, Charger was replaced with a non-Apple brand\u2026 which with our particular style\u2026 It makes this adapter non-compatible to our charging device. Take note!! Before purchasing, double check computer chargee just to ensure you order an item that will actually work- avoiding the mistake to begin..!!!<br \/><br \/>I can tell you this came boxed very nice and well packaged with necessary padding to protect in transit. This also includes a silicone sleeve and this is a total perk! Trying to keep 2 individual pieces connected this sleeve will help ensure proper adhesiveness taking both items and creating peace of mind as one (Im sure we all know what can happen if they accidentally separate mid use.. not good things!) to give an idea think Hydro flask sleeve placed on bottom of a bottle to give extra support and protection. This accessory works in the same capacity\u2026 as it just slides on adapter for a snug secure fit. Again, nice bonus!<br \/><br \/>Overall, if seller can become more efficient in clarifying items in photo vs. items received- this would go along way to ensure that customers know what they are buying- and can do so with confidence."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"\"Heavy Weight\" with Solid Sound","text":"The product arrived very quickly, within 4 days. When I saw the box at the doorstep and went to pick it up. was shocked at how heavy the relatively small box was. Good sign! At least I knew it wasn't made out of ' Plastic from China'. My previous  Desktop 6 CD changer had long stopped working, as it would not 'read' discs as was the case with the previous one . After reading multiple reviews of multiple 'Table Top\" multi-CD changers (all- in  -ones) It seems that is a recurring theme.<br \/><br \/>I have a few hundred CDs and already started Ripping them to hear on the phone via Bluetooth, but if I could just find a single CD player that would be reliable with Blue Tooth and perhaps even a slot for a USB stick (I could get into that too).<br \/><br \/>This player seemed to be the ticket and it is. The user guide is very large with pictures,  though the instructions are not 'the best', but the player really is simple enough. If you can work one in a car, then this is no different.<br \/><br \/>I connected the speakers which didn't take long, the ones from my previous player, and was up and running within 5 minutes. T . The sound quality is far better than my previous player which size wise was much larger.<br \/><br \/> . Actually, from the time I took it out of the box to the time I was listening to the first CD in it, was about 20 minutes (with the Blue tooth connected by then too). I shared some photos with a CD beside the player in this review so you can compare how big it is. The volume for my 2 bedroom condo is great, wouldn't need anything any louder, and it's clear sound (even with the likely very cheap speakers I have right now). So far, it's only Day 1 having it, but no complaints so far. Nicely, had just received an offer for Amazon Prime the same day, so have been using the blue tooth to take advantage of that. If you need a player that won't skip during an earthquake, this seems to be the one.<br \/><br \/> I tried playing a CD recorded using Windows Media Player, a variety of song copied down from YouTube put to CD, and the CD worked fine. Was also able to insert a USB stick with Music copied to it from the computer and with the help of the Very Rapid Response Customer Service was enabled to work through a 'glitch' on my end in regard to how the player reads music stored on the USB device (which happens to be , 'a separate folder for each ripped CD' )"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Bose sound bar","text":"After a lifetime of working in and around industrial sites my husband is a bit hard of hearing. We are constantly battling over the sound of the TV... I can hear normally, so when he puts the sound at level he can hear the conversations, it feels like it is blasting our my ear drums!  We've had several sets of headphones... they are uncomfortable and he then can't hear me if I am asking him something...  so we decided to give this a try.  A couple of things... neither of are &#34;techies&#34; and were able to plug into our newer (less than 2 months old Samsung 65&#34; TV) in an instant.  So that was good.  If you turn it on it is an amazing sound upgrade from your TV sound system.  Very noticeable.  When you push the little conversation icon which is supposed to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation portion of the sound, it is noticeable.  Perhaps not as dramatic, but it helps.  We are able to find a happy medium.  You are able to adjust the bass when you don't feel like having the &#34;theater&#34; experience.  It is a &#34;bar&#34; that sits just below our wall - hung TV.  It's about 30 or so inches long and about 3&#34; tall.  It does have the Bose logo right in the middle.  At first I wasn't thrilled about looking at it ... but I find I don't notice it now and it sort of helps to hide the cords - bonus.  As noted on other reviews... you do have to click on the &#34;conversation icon&#34; to &#34;enhance&#34; the conversation sound every single time you turn it on.  It would be nice if it just stayed on that position.  Also, it would NOT &#34;learn&#34; my new Samsung blue ray player or my TV... so the &#34;universal remote&#34; thing is not really happening.  The remote is very large and cumbersome for just turning on and off the sound bar...  I even researched the internet to be certain I had the right &#34;universal codes&#34; for my DVD player... Still didn't work.  So.... if you don't really care about adding just one more remote the sound quality is truly an upgrade from your TV. It really makes the sound match the quality of the picture I am seeing on my TV.  The conversation enhancement is noticeable, but maybe not as dramatic as you might hope - still - it's helpful.  We are definitely keeping it.  I never shy away from updating my reviews if new info would be helpful.  Further, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews."}

I don't use these anymore. Waste of money that's headed to electronics recycling. Wouldn't recommend you buy.<br \/><br \/>ORIGINAL REVIEW: Works perfectly. With products like this, my biggest concern going into a purchase is whether bluetooth disconnection and reconnection will be reliable. I am able to toggle easily between Google Voice and my regular phone line on my cell plus Zoom and Slack on my PC.

The only hitch I had was with the connection. The instructions are fairly clear but I had to do some experimentation to get everything to work with my television.  One thing of note which might help ATT Uverse customers -- plug the red and white RCA connectors to the actual Uverse box (at the rear -- Audio Out) rather than to your television. I think this may have been mentioned by another reviewer but I had overlooked it earlier. Plugging into the unit eliminates the static also.  One last thing -- I would advise buyers of this product to purchase extra pads for the headphones. Once a style is no longer universally available the replacement pads can be very hard to find. For the $16 it is worth the money and saves grief later on."}

I followed the directions and charged them first before using them. They may have been partially charged to begin with, but I didn't check. Pairing it to my phone was probably the easiest pairing ever! There's a QRL code in the directions and scanning that was all it took. They are surprisingly comfortable to wear and don't annoy me at all. There are a couple of different sizes of the silicone ear piece  in case you need a larger or smaller size. I'm still learning how to use them, but I'm slowly getting the hang of it. Phone calls sound good and the recipients have been able to fully hear and understand me as well. You can lower or increase the sound by tapping the ear bud, but it's unnatural for me to do that, so about half of the time I keep using my phone to adjust the volume. I have been having fun with these!!"}

The case is thin and not very protective, though, so I think the idea of giving this to a teenager there may be better (more protective) alternatives.

It gets really annoying and loud with 2 different soundtracks going on simultaneously. They were using ear buds when watching their clips, but those broke before the holidays. After a week of no headphones, I decided to order these for them. I actually ordered 3 pairs, one for each of our classroom computers. These aren't super high quality headphones, but they are working great for our students. Yes, it would be wonderful if we had some of those nice, padded, over the ear earphones, but we don't. Since these were purchased with my own money, this was what was in my budget. I'm not sure I would order these for myself, but for the students, they do the job!"}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Pros & Cons.*Need*to have a good router to handle any streaming options for this system to work.","text":"This review is assuming you know what Steam is, and have an account + avid gamer. If you do not know what those are, this is not the system for you. The price point on this is steep if you don't already have games for this system. With that being said, it is a a neat concept. The controllers are awesome! It will take a little while to figure them out, have fun typing with the touch pads, it took me a few minutes to get it down. Great to be able to play some of the games on this, however due to the OS on this not all of the games are available for this, which then requires the Steam streaming setup. From my experiences with this, the streaming does not work well without a good router. From a PC with ethernet to this with ethernet from the same router it was not playable. But if thats the case then Ill play on the desktop for the intense games.<br \/><br \/>Pro:<br \/>Its Steam. If you have an account and have been playing their games since forever, you have the games.<br \/>High learning curve for this controller for anyone thats been using an xbox or playstation controller, however the functionality is really enjoyable.<br \/>The two touchpad for the controllers is very interesting. I was playing boarder lands and the right touch pad with as low as they go movement sensitivity is really a challenge to get that working correctly.<br \/>The controllers community presets are a good place to start when trying to get the buttons to be useful.<br \/><br \/>Con:<br \/>I've had Amnesia and couple other games on medium settings lock up on me multiple times and thats without multitasking. With the game paused, I try the browser and the system occasionally locks up. So my next thought is to wipe the whole thing and start over with it...Not that big of a priority at the moment as<br \/><br \/>*Need*to have a good router to handle any streaming options for this system to work.<br \/><br \/>The TB hard drive is very nice for the space, however the load times would of course be much better with SSD inside.<br \/><br \/>The processor is a 4th gen, which works well but with the current 6th gens out it seems that they can have that updated with the pricing. Possibly would help with this locking up?<br \/><br \/>The Steam OS is nice being that it requires less to load, but functionality is a bit disappointing. Because of this operating system, the games can not be downloaded to the Machine.<br \/><br \/>Terrible luck with trying to stream anything from the PC to this.<br \/><br \/>For anyone looking to have a streaming solution for Steam, a Steam Link might be the way to go and put some more $ in your pc.

(It\u2019s not a good choice for a news junkie like myself, as my favorite local news-only stations are all on AM channels.)<br \/><br \/>The FM radio speaker sounds very tinny, so you won\u2019t want to use the radio to listen to music.  It\u2019s okay, I think, for playing FM music to wake you up.  If you don\u2019t like the speaker, you can just use the plain alarm-sound option.  You can also connect the clock to an auxiliary MP3 device.<br \/><br \/>The beeper alarm doesn\u2019t sound overly loud to me, even at the maximum volume.  It takes many seconds for the volume to increase from the initial faint beep to the maximum.  To wake out of a really sound sleep, you need a high-volume alarm.<br \/><br \/>It\u2019s nice being able to set two different alarms.  The alarms are NOT tied to specific days of the week--you just turn on the one you want.  One alarm is at the left of the clock, the other is at the right.  Two people who rise at different times will like this feature, or one person can use it for something like weekdays and weekends.<br \/><br \/>The digital display is large enough to read from across a room.  However, the display is NOT so bright that it will interfere with sleeping.  The time is easy to program by sliding the \u201cLock\u201d button, holding down the volume button until the correct time is displayed, and sliding the Lock button back to locked position.<br \/><br \/>Another nice feature is the battery backup.  It takes two AAA batteries, and ensures that your alarm will go off on time even if you have a power outage while you\u2019re sleeping."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Workhorse with plenty of horsepower.","text":"First there is a cool factor of owning an Alienware product, the look and design of this laptop are several notches above what other laptops look like. I own MacBook 2020, and two other Dell laptops. This by far looks the coolest, but what we really care about is what's under the hood.<br \/><br \/>I was a bit concerned the display wasn't 4k but screen size is small enough to where it actually looks a bit sharper than my LG Ultrafine 4K displays. Color looks great.<br \/><br \/>I tried to run a user benchmark a few times with no luck for some reason. Wanted to see how it compared to my workstation. Tried updating drivers but still had issues with testing the GPU performance. So I decided to do an actual test with one of the tasks I do the most, video editing.<br \/><br \/>I recently bought a Dell workstation for editing a couple months ago and wanted to compare it with the m15 R4. My workstation specs i7-10700K, GeForce RTX 2060 Super, SSD, 32GB RAM. As a hobby I do a lot of video\/photo editing. I have a couple decades of IT experience.<br \/><br \/>A little background. I switched to shooting in 4k 60 FPS with my DSLRs and drone footage. Even the most powerful consumer systems available 3-4 years ago have a hard time ripping these massive files and it's almost impossible to get any performance while editing. I use Adobe Premiere for all my video editing.<br \/><br \/>I took one of my more complicated Premiere projects and did a few tests. Both systems did a great job in edit, meaning little to no lag while scrolling through a massive timeline at 100% playback resolution. Once again this is 4K video all at 60FPS, need emphasize that.<br \/><br \/>Ripping\/Rendering this 45 min project with GPU assistance took 37 mins on my workstation and 42 min on the M15. This same edit on my MacBook took just over 2 hours and was only half way at 4 hours with my older Dell laptops.<br \/><br \/>Overall very pleased with the video editing performance from the m15  As far as gaming goes my son plays fortnight and gets over 200 FPS with the M15.<br \/><br \/>Everything else works as expected. Multi color backlit keyboard looks great."}

I set this up in my bedroom and was super impressed with the quality of this Polaroid television.

I also find the sound quality of this set impressive, too (no need for me to attach my sound bar). All and all, very impressed.

The entire headphone set exudes nothing but quality. The ear buds rotate into place and the head band extends as necessary. The headphone wire plugs into the base of the left ear bud and the other end attaches to the audio source.  The headphones are also incredibly lightweight--what I would call airy.  They also come in a sturdy zippered case for storage.  At $129.99 they are expensive but after having listened through these, I believe they are worth it. With all the ear phones I've purchased over the years, I definitely spent over $200 because I had to throw all my previous headphones out after they failed within months of purchase.

This would have been worth every penny as it surely would have protected my ipad from the 24 inch tumble it took.<br \/><br \/>But more about this case, I have a first Gen Mini and it fits perfectly.  The case seals the iPad in and gives huge, crystal clear views of both the front and back.  The feel of the rubber armor is soft and confortable.  The edges are rounded and comfortable in the hand.  All ports are available to me behind water sealing tabs and plugs.  I have no problem charging while in the case or plugging in head phones.<br \/><br \/>All around, this is one of the best designed cases I have seen.  Although take the caveat that it is designed to protect so it is not as elegant as a leather case or something, but for young child damage or in my case fluke clumsiness, it is fantastic.  I don't plan on putting it in water, but I have faith that it will buy a second chance if dropped in a puddle. And all of this protection without loss of functionality.

Setting up features on the watch is a bit complicated.  I never did figure out how to set time and date directly on the watch.  There is an application that you can use to make settings and I had to load that application to my cell phone and when I started using the application, the time and day got set automatically.  I still haven't figured out some of the features of the watch, as they are not obvious.  I got it because it monitors blood pressure and heart rate.  Those functions work well so it serves my purpose.  This is my first smart watch, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I assume there may be better smart watches that are easier to figure out.  Once I learn how to fully use it, I may like it a lot better.  I just think the user interface could have been better and you shouldn't need a cell phone application to do basic time and day settings.  Perhaps you don't, but there is no obvious way to do it directly on the watch.  The free cell phone application that you have to install from the internet also doesn't seem that straightforward to use and I struggled a little with it also.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"It's Important and It Works !!","text":"Had one for over a year now and bought a second one for a private bedroom in case something happens in there. The buttons and dialer are great and will work the distance probably in any size house. The speaker phone part is not as sensitive as I would like, if you fall in one room and push the button, it's hard to hear a person that fell if they are too far away from the speakerphone part that is in the base unit. That's why I bought a second one. I did a lot of research among these with both a monthly plan and just the dialer like this one, and this unit is far better then almost all the others I looked into. My dad wears his on a Necklace around his neck<br \/><br \/>AND - about 6 months ago in 2012 - it probably saved my 94 year old Father's life !! Just like on TV, he fell and just couldn't get up by himself - pushed the button to call me - and I heard him in the background saying what happened and in 5 minutes I was there helping him. AND, if we weren't home or not close by his house, he also has the red emergency button for 911 if he couldn't reach us. That red one always works and tells 911 something is wrong and the location.<br \/><br \/>It Works !! and it's not just for old people that might fall down or worse, you can program it to call anyone and also has many other programing options. Definitely a great unit."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Acer Gets \"Convertible\" Laptop Concept Exactly Right!","text":"This little ACER ASPIRE SWITCH 10 LAPTOP has a display to die for.  To my eye, it's as clear and sharp as the iPad Mini Retinal display.  And the display is quick!  Pages load fast, and the touchscreen is very responsive.<br \/><br \/>In designing this little \"convertible\" laptop, Acer got the concept exactly right.  The display and keyboard together constitute a small notebook computer that is just large enough for doing real writing work.  (As long as you don't type too fast--there is a slight delay in communications between the keyboard and display.)  The built-in, buttonless mouse works smoothly, and I like the feature where you push the lower left or lower right corner of the mousepad to left-click or right-click.  (You do have to watch that you don't move the mouse pointer off target when you click.)  This laptop even comes with a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365 (software is installed, the activation code is in the box).<br \/><br \/>But the \"convertible\" laptop is also a standalone tablet with a sensitive, fast touchscreen.  The display lifts off easily from two tabs at the back of the keyboard, so that you can check email, shop online, or search the Internet without holding up any extra keyboard weight.  When you're done using the tablet, the display clicks back onto the tabs, and the laptop closes up like any standard laptop (so you don't need a tablet cover, or even a screen protector for the touchscreen).  The settings that allow you to shut down or put the laptop to sleep when you close the cover work as usual. The display can also be detached and reattached facing backwards, so that the keyboard becomes a display stand.<br \/><br \/>This little Windows 8.1 laptop can do a lot of things.  The display\/tablet has a webcam, stereo speakers, a microphone for sound recording, a microSD card slot, a microUSB connector for connecting to USB devices, an HDMI micro connector that supports hi-def digital video connections, a headset\/speaker jack,  and a DC-in jack for charging.<br \/><br \/>The keyboard has a single USB port.  I used the USB port to connect an external CD\/DVD drive and play music from a CDROM.  The USB port is also useful for file transfers via flash drive, or for backing up files to an external storage drive.  Because this little notebook has only 64GB storage capacity (other tablets have 16GB to 64GB storage capacity), you will almost certainly need to back up music, pictures, and other files to an external drive or to cloud storage eventually.  But you can also copy files off the tablet without using wireless or connecting the tablet via USB cable to another PC, because the tablet\/keyboard combo is a full-fledged Win8.1 computer.<br \/><br \/>I like this ACER ASPIRE SWITCH 10 a lot, because it is so compact, portable, extremely lightweight, and versatile. And  I even like the Windows 8.1 operating system, which makes a lot of sense for a small tablet computer like this one."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Extremely Fast Powerline With Simple Setup; Needs Available Electrical Outlets","text":"This NETGEAR POWERLINE 1200 performs as advertised, but it isn't the best choice for my personal situation.  My household is set up with two routers and two independent networks.  My plan (doomed to failure, as conceptually flawed) was to use the Powerline to connect a wired printer that could be used by ANY device connected to EITHER network.  In practice, the wired printer worked fine with both networks, but only with one network at a time.  As I would have known if I'd thought things through, the wired printer was only able to work with the network that was controlled by the one router that the Powerline itself was physically connected to (by Ethernet cable).<br \/><br \/>Basically, the way that Powerline adapters work is this:  You start with two adapters.  You plug the first adapter into a power outlet (NOT a surge protector or power strip), and connect the adapter (by Ethernet cable) to your router or Internet access source.  Then you plug the second adapter into a power outlet near the wired device that needs Internet access, and connect that device (by Ethernet cable) to the adapter.  The adapters then communicate with each other over your house wiring, and your wired device that is located far away from your router will now have Internet access.<br \/><br \/>The setup for the NETGEAR POWERLINE 1200 is very simple.  The one setup problem I ran into, was that the adapter's  LED light for the Ethernet cable connection (required for the Powerline to work) didn't light up when I first connected my wireless printer.  Once I disabled the wireless connection and changed the printer settings to those for a wired LAN connection, the LED light came on, and the Powerline worked perfectly.  I could use the wired LAN printer anywhere in my house where there was an open electrical outlet that would accommodate the Powerline adapter.  When I connected the printer via the Powerline, it seemed to print faster than it does with a wireless connection.<br \/><br \/>However, I encountered a physical problem when I tried to plug a Powerline adapter into the one open electrical outlet near my router.  The two-plug electrical outlet already had a backup battery\/surge protector plugged in, and the big plug on the backup battery's cord was angled in a way that wouldn't allow me to plug in the Powerline adapter below it.  What I did, was swap the backup battery for a power strip with a smaller plug, because I had to plug a router, a modem, and a Powerline adapter into that two-plug outlet. When it came to plugging the Powerline adapter into an outlet near the wired printer, I was sorry that I didn't have the slightly more expensive [[ASIN:B00S6DBGIS Netgear Powerline 1200 + Extra Outlet (PLP1200-100PAS)]], because I had to relocate a shredder that was using the lower part of another two-plug outlet.  Open electrical outlets are in short supply in my house!<br \/><br \/>The only other problem I had, was that the Powerline caused some of my wireless intercoms to hum when in use.  The intercoms are battery-powered, but they are obviously encountering some radio interference.  This isn't the fault of the Netgear Powerline, because my house wiring was installed in 1986, just ahead of the Internet age.  Other devices that I've tried to use with house wiring have caused much worse feedback, or have completely failed to work in some outlets.  However, if you have older house wiring, you may want to go with wireless devices instead of a device like this one that uses your house wiring.<br \/><br \/>Also, keep in mind that you will need a Powerline adapter and an open electrical outlet for EACH wired device that you want to connect to your network.  The Powerline works by adapters (connected by Ethernet cable to devices) that communicate with one another.  It does NOT add an Internet connection to your house wiring, but instead sends signals from adapter to adapter through your house wiring."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Nice Quality","text":"My son likes creating music on his computer. He recently purchased $300 speakers to use with his computer specifically for making music. His desk is not very big, plus it's a standing one that goes up and down as needed. There's no room on his desk for his speakers and even if there was, he would worry that they would not be stable on the desk. These speaker stands are solving his dilemma. They're a nice quality and very durable. His speakers are little larger than the shelf on the stand, but it doesn't seem to be an issue. Assembly was easy. He decided not to thread the cables through the stand mainly because they wouldn't be long enough since they have to reach the back of the computer. These stands are working well for what he needed."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Large stand with room to store necessary office and other items; however, the stand I received is not level.","text":"I purchased two [[ASIN:B0036RA5EA Allsop Metal Art Junior Monitor Stands]] for my work monitors. Since I have my own monitor for my other computer, I also wanted a monitor stand for that which is why I ordered this.<br \/><br \/>This one is very nice but it is larger than I expected. It is 20 inches wide (side-to-side) and 11-1\/2&#34; in depth (front to back) where as my Allsop stands are  each 14-3\/4&#34; x 11&#34; respectively. Had I purchased two of these for my work monitors, I could not fit them on my desk.<br \/><br \/>Nevertheless, this mesh stand is beautifully made and has a drawer that easily slides in and out. The front drawer is protected in back from sliding out the other side. The right side pockets offer additional storage. If one has the room, this stand is perfect.<br \/><br \/>This would have received five stars from me except that it is not level. As you can see in the first picture, one leg is a half inch too short so it tilts back and forth like an uneven chair. However, once the monitor is on the stand, it is not too noticeable. Due to the large size, I am using this to elevate a speaker I have and since it is sitting on carpet, the uneven leg is not an issue for me."}

The Fire Stick works, but the interface is the Amazon TV interface, which is not user friendly and can be difficult to find things. I just don't like the way it is arranged. The Roku is arranged better, in my opinion. It is easy to set up. You will need a device able to access a website during the set up. Many of the channels are subscription services in themselves. Some are free, but not many. You'll really need additional subscriptions (like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Slingbox, etc.) to really make the most of the device. (I personally use Amazon Prime and Netflix.) I like the new design of the Roku remote. The raised enter button makes it easier to use without having to look at it. The only advantage the Fire Stick has over the Roku is the size and ability to hide it behind the TV. The Roku box, while small, still has to be placed somewhere where the remote can &#34;see&#34; it."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Solid and Portable, But Center Your Tablet With Care","text":"The ARKON PORTABLE FOLD-UP STAND is compact when folded (7\" long by 1\" wide by 1-1\/8\" high), and very solid when set up, which makes it a good choice for a tablet stand if your primary need is portability.  However, your tablet is placed in notches in the stand's two base supports, and merely leans against the stand's single upright support.  This arrangement is a bit unstable--not because the stand isn't solid, but because your tablet (in my case, an iPad) can topple sideways off the stand if it's not carefully centered when placed on the stand.<br \/><br \/>The stand will hold your tablet in either the horizontal or vertical position. The upright support can be adjusted to a multitude of angles in relation to the surface on which the stand is placed, and it is hinged, which allows even more viewing angles.  However, I found the hinged part confusing to use--it was hard for me to adjust the hinge quickly to get an optimal viewing angle.  The stand has soft gripper pads that hold the stand securely on a smooth surface without slipping.  The stand also has gripper pads in the notches on the base supports and on the upright support wherever it contacts the back of your tablet.<br \/><br \/>For me, an iPad case with a built-in easel stand is a better solution, because it requires less setup and holds the iPad without danger of toppling over.  For this reason, I rate the ARKON PORTABLE FOLD-UP STAND at 3 stars ('it's okay\" on the official Amazon scale)."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"For over burn, requires disks that don't seem to be available from normal retailers","text":"In order to try the over burn feature, I would need the appropriate disks that can normally hold 8.5 GB (DVD+R).  These disks are not too difficult to find online, but the office supply stores only seem to stock 4.7 GB disks.  I guess you either have to special order or buy online.  Most everything that I need to burn can either fit on a 4.7 GB DVD or can be compressed (without much loss of quality) to fit.  It may be false economy to buy the higher capacity disks, as they are nearly double the price of lower capacity.  With burnable media prices being so low anyway, you don't gain much by squeezing as much as you can on a particular disk.  So why did I get this drive?  I like to have a drive on the shelf if one goes bad (and they do sometimes), and then I don't have to wait for one to arrive.  I assumed it was probably good to have one that can burn to maximum capacity as this isn't much more expensive than a regular DVD burner.  Since I haven't actually installed or used the drive yet (waiting for disks), one should not pay as much attention to my review as some other reviewers.  I just wanted people to be aware that you can't insert a 4.7 GB disk and expect to over burn to 8.7 GB.  You need to understand the differences in available media and get the appropriate blank media. Update:  I finally received the appropriate media to test the drive.  It seemed to work good for the first 6 or 8 disks, but then 3 disks in a row had burn errors.  Bad media?  I don't think so; it appears the drive is failing already.  I'll test on another computer and see if it is the media or the drive and update the review again, but right now I can't recommend this drive at all.  UPDATE 2:  I tried this again after rebooting my computer and it now seems to work fine and does indeed overburn, so you can squeeze a lot on one disk.  When I had 3 bad burns in a row, I thought it was the burner, but it may have been bad media.  On the other hand, I suspect something flaky on my PC, as I have had bad burns before occasionally (not recently) and then after a reboot everything was fine again.  I may have too many programs loaded when I try to burn.  That's not the fault of the DVD drive.  Most likely the fault of the burning program (and I am using a major well-know program.)"}

Playback (which I don't get until the next day) just loops the entire day so quickly you cannot see what was recorded. Right now I am on the 30 day free cloud trial. I am not subscribing so plugged in a usb initially to record events. The software never shows the control tab to get to the USB recordings. The free trial sign blocks it. So I removed the USB until the trial is over and will update this review then, when I start using that for monitoring. Also, there are no snapshot images - just video. I have looked online at their site for these issues and have checked all settings as they recommend - still no solution. Does not handle changes in daylight well. Either blinds out the image or turns it all blue at dusk just to be obscured once it is nighttime by condensation (see attached snapshot of video notifications - top is actually night time video, one below it is dus, one below that is daytime). Fortunately, I got these just to keep an eye on my cats in my yard. I would not use these for any serious security purposes. The only positive is that if you are watching a live view during the daytime, it is pretty decent image. However, annoying that Live View constantly asks if you want to continue in live view after only about 5 seconds. It should stay on live view until I turn it off. - maybe it is a battery thing but annoying as it interrupts what I am viewing."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Great Bag for Regular Use...","text":"This bag is really awesome for regular bag use. Carrying books and things in this is really great. However, it is listed as a bag for electronics, and on that it really falls short. Yes, there is a padded pocket in the interior large enough for my 15\" MacBook Pro or my full size iPad. However, the padding is really minimal and it will only hold one device protected in that manner. The side pockets and front pocket have no padding for other electronics. I do like the adjustability of the bag. It can fold shorter to be more of a messenger bag shape or if you need the space, it unfolds to regular book bag size. The straps are comfortable, though they are not padded at all.<br \/><br \/>If your looking for an attractive book bag that will also hold and minimally protect your laptop or tablet- this is your bag! If you're looking for something to hold and protect more of your electronics or camera, this isn't the bag you need."}

The other cool thing is that you get a clip that can be attached to your clothes or a bag. The case is so small that it may be easy to lose otherwise.

It looked different and was easier to get onto the camera. I'm wondering if the one I bought was older stock that came with the difficult back plate and now they have a better updated one. Was able to put it together and now it works well.<br \/>Do note that the services provided for free are basic and do not include recording. I don't believe you can do live view if you do battery install, unless someone is at the door and it alerts you (just can just pull it up and view live whenever you want). Otherwise decent deal for what I paid and able to have a bit more security. The basic plan with video recording is $30 a year which I feel is decent if I have to pay for it. I can see my door and my car in case I need the video for anything. Also useful to post to neighbors if I catch anything suspicious happening as we have a lot of foot traffic  where I live<br \/><br \/>First review below, I updated it above:<br \/>I've watched several videos  read instructions and using all of my strength the camera will NOT lock onto the back.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Slim, Portable Design and Great Audio","text":"This slim, portable speaker takes up amazingly little space, but produces surprisingly robust sound. We set up our Sound Kick Bluetooth Speaker at the end of our dining table (against a wall), since it's in a pretty central location in our house. I then followed a few easy instructions to plug in the device and pair it with my iPhone - we had music streaming from Pandora in just a few minutes! And even at much louder volumes, the speaker maintained the integrity of the music.<br \/><br \/>I love that the Sound Kick is so easy to use, with very intuitive controls. You can pause, forward, or reverse music and change the volume from the speaker itself, and there is a dedicated \"Pair\" button for using with various Bluetooth devices. You can plug the Sound Kick in with the included AC power cord, or it can run for up to 7 hours off the internal rechargeable battery.<br \/><br \/>We played with the Bluetooth range of the Sound Kick, and were surprised that I could walk into other rooms of my house with my iPhone, and the Sound Kick would keep broadcasting the music. I also think it's very interesting that the Sound Kick has a built-in USB port, so if I want to, I can charge my iPhone while playing music to avoid draining the battery.<br \/><br \/>Finally, I'm super impressed with the versatility of the Sound Kick's line-in audio jack, allowing it to connect to any device with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack. I sometimes use it to boost the audio on videos I show to my small Sunday School class on my Kindle Fire. So, while the Sound Kick works beautifully as a wireless Bluetooth speaker, it can also be used with non-Bluetooth devices as well - a total added value in my opinion.<br \/><br \/>I have seen others comment on the decreased volume when using the Sound Kick on battery, and I agree, but it hasn't posed any kind of problem for me. Overall, we're thrilled with this speaker and it has absolutely done the trick for us.<br \/><br \/>-Disclosure: I have received a Soundfreaq Sound Kick to facilitate this review."}

BUT...if you happen to have the same problem, hang in there! These headphones really are incredible!<br \/><br \/>What I didn't realize at first was these come with one of the optional &#34;wing&#34; skins already on. I had been trying to put another pair of the wings on over it, and it was awful. But lo and behold, when I took the one skin off and put the correct wing size on...then figured out the right bud size for me...then figured out exactly how to twist them in, allow the wing to hook under the groove in my ear, and press slightly to get a good seal in my ear canal...WOW, these have amazing sound!<br \/><br \/>They have been very easy to pair with any device, I love the charging dock, and I've been able to run them a long time before re-charging. I might be most impressed by the range, though. I do use these when working out, but more often I use them while doing housework, and I can go several rooms apart - putting laundry away, even going outside to dump the garbage - and the sound stays constant.

To use with an iPad, you just (1) switch the keyboard on, (2) press the \"connect\" button, (3) use iPad Settings\/General\/Bluetooth to find the keyboard, (4) click on the name of the found keyboard, and (5) enter the code that pops up.  (The keyboard requires iOS 4.0 or later to connect to an iPhone 3G or iPod Touch.)<br \/><br \/>The featherweight keyboard is quite reasonably priced.  It's a little smaller than the keyboard on my Toshiba netbook (3.5\" rather than 4\" high, 9.5\" rather than 10\" wide).  Because I have large hands, my fingers are somewhat scrunched up, but I was able to adapt quickly.  The keys are flat-topped, rather than contoured.  There are the usual \"hot keys\" that wake the iPad, go to the Home screen, adjust the volume, do fast forward\/back, go to the Search screen, etc.  The keyboard goes into sleep mode automatically after 15 minutes of inactivity.  A USB charger cable is included, so that the keyboard can be recharged by plugging it in to a computer (or into an AC outlet if you have an adaptor).<br \/><br \/>This keyboard does not attach to the iPad, a case, or anything else.  I like having a free-standing keyboard, because I can place it anywhere that's comfortable for typing, well away from the iPad itself.  The keyboard is molded so that it is angled slightly upwards when placed on a flat surface, and it has nice rubberized grippers that keep it from sliding around on my desktop.  A black, velvety-textured, drawstring carrying bag is included to protect the keyboard in transit or in storage.<br \/><br \/>Quality control could be a problem with this keyboard.  Mine had a loose area at the lower right corner, which made the keys in that corner rattle.  However the fix was easy:  pressing down firmly between the keys settled the corner under the clip that was there to hold it in place.  I like this keyboard a lot, and will be using it regularly with my iPad.  I rate it at 4.5 stars, rounded down to 4 stars because of the quality control issue."}

They are very thin, but sturdy so they don't kink up easily, as some cables will.  I like them and might get some more for other connections in my network.  Unfortunately the cables are a little short and I just barely got one of them to reach.  If I get any more, I'll have to see if they make a 10 or 12 foot version.  Other than length, the only other downside I can see is that these are somewhat pricey.  You get what you pay for, so they may be well worth it."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Amazing sound with a few small drawbacks","text":"I've had several sets of Bose Companion speakers over the years, but this was my first experience with a Bose Bluetooth product. Setup was quick and easy, and as you can use the speaker as the battery is charging for the first time (plugged in), I had my speaker powered up and connected within five minutes of unpacking. You can pair the SoundLink III with up to six devices and it will automatically connect to the last known device. With a 30-foot range, you can be several rooms away and still get crystal-clear sound.<br \/><br \/>The sound quality is fantastic...good bass for a speaker this size. You can also REALLY crank up the volume on this one; sound is still full and balanced at max volume. I love that the unit is portable and holds a charge for quite a while (up to 14 hours; the battery lasts up to two years). Because the battery is not user-replaceable, I tend to keep it plugged in when I am using it for long periods.<br \/><br \/>The one downside is the fact that there is no remote; it would be nice to at least be able to adjust the volume remotely rather than walking over to my phone and using the volume buttons, or walking over to the speaker and using the buttons on top, which are covered with a rubberized layer, but this is a small issue overall."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Initial Reaction: Excellent! (See Updates Below)","text":"Believe me when I tell you I read and read and read about these high-end RDs before making my choice. After reading the reviews on Amazon, I was very uncertain. But after looking at reviews by people in the tech biz, I decided to take the plunge and so far I am very glad I did.<br \/><br \/>After  very limited usage, this is what I have found (all I can do is speak for the unit I own):<br \/>1. the suction cups that came with the unit adhere to my windshield. The connection seems strong and tight. I left the cups on the windshield in 20-degree weather -- they have not budged. So far I see no need to buy a more deluxe suction device. I do remove the unit itself when I am out of the vehicle;<br \/><br \/>2. the manual indicates that the RD is to be positioned flush against the windshield. So far I do not see a problem with that position. As I drive I have been keeping an eye on the unit. It remains steady, it shows no signs of movement on local streets (not the smoothest on God's earth, either);<br \/><br \/>3. I was able to update the database of cameras by downloading the detector tools from the mfg. website. Since mine is a newer unit, I connected the unit via USB to a netbook, powered up the RD, clicked on the icons in the downloaded software, and was finished this process in about 15-20 mins. I did NOT have to do this download in my vehicle. The USB connection (netbook-to-RD) was all that was necessary; Note: until I turned the unit ON during the software update installation, the detector tools could not verify my serial number and the install would not proceed. (See my review of the AmazonBasics cable, which is the one you want for this RD.)<br \/><br \/>4. so far the unit has functioned as described in the manual: it has very, very few false alarms, it stores detected points as I drive, I have it set on AUTO as recommended for the best hiway-city setting;<br \/><br \/>5. compared to other detectors I have owned, which have all been in the $150 range, the Passport is by far the best at this early stage;<br \/><br \/>I have yet to see how this baby behaves when I am on turnpikes and other places under surveillance by the good folks in blue. I am not a lead-foot particularly, I just love electronics; but there are times when the lull of the road will cause excessive speed. I like to be prepared.<br \/><br \/>As I get more experience with this unit on the road, I will update this review. For now, I can honestly say this unit deserves the very high marks it has received on tech review websites. It looks and feels very well made.<br \/><br \/>I am glad I made the move upward. I encourage you to do the same!<br \/><br \/>First Update:<br \/>So far I have had no problems with the windshield suction cups adhering to the glass. The temperatures here have been between 20 and 50 degrees. From time to time I will press on the nubs to check the strength of the grip, and sometimes I will hear a \"clicking\" sound which \"resets\" the cups to full strength.<br \/><br \/>I have been doing local driving only and there is very little \"chatter\" from the unit. I can only assume it is doing its job. It goes through the power up sequence just fine. I have not passed any stationary police vehicles. Another update will follow when I have somethinbg significant to report.<br \/><br \/>Second Update: (April 21)<br \/>I finally had a chance to drive on the open road on a 4-hour round-trip. I can only assume that this detector is doing its job. True, I did not eyeball ANY police vehicles on my trip. The detector did not report any, either. So, is it working? As I say, I can only assume so. It did fire off several K-band alerts along the route, but nothing more.<br \/><br \/>In my home area there are many speed cameras installed. My detector would have me believe than none are operative, since I have yet to receive a single camera alert. BTW, I am current on all updates via USB. I have nothing else to report, other than the fact that the unit powers up and self-tests as it should.<br \/><br \/>Third Update May 14, 2013<br \/>For the first time since purchasing this detector it identified red light camera locations. I am now satisfied that this function is working properly.<br \/><br \/>Fourth Update July 14, 2013<br \/>Even in extremely hot vehicle interior temperatures, the windshield suction cups have remained in place. As a matter of fact, the clip has not moved since I first attached it back in February."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Escort PASSPORT S55 Radar Detector","text":"First, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews...I purchased this detector for my sedan.  It is pretty large compared to my other detectors, but not terribly so.  I have provided some pics with a ruler so you can consider.  It came with an &#34;accessory&#34; kit... but honestly, it doesn't really need it as it comes with the cord and suction cup windshield attachment. It doesn't come with a lot of instructions, but it's pretty easy to figure out how settings work. I do find it nice to have a spare cord (in the accessory kit) - they don't last forever.  The cord comes with an easily reachable &#34;mute&#34; button.  Nice if your windshield is deep and therefore more inconvenient to reach.  Although, I usually keep my detectors on &#34;auto mute&#34; so after a few beeps it stops.It has a phone jack connector (see pic) which is different for me - but doesn't seem to effect it's use.  One of the nicest things I can say so far about this detector is that the screen is BRIGHT and inset.  So it is VERY easy to read when it's silent.  An important feature to me.  It also came with a lovely case.  I included a pic of the outside with measurements and an inside view of the case.  The suction cup windshield attachment has a very easy to use &#34;release&#34; button so you can leave the suction cups just were they need to be, collect the detector, place in it's case and take it with you.  In Arizona it gets super hot.  So even though I have a carport, I take my detector inside or with me 99% of the time if I will be longer than 30 minutes.  So far, it seems to do what a radar detector is meant to do, reminding me to take my foot off the gas pedal. It is also good to note that if you are hit with a laser, it's too late before you hear the alarm.  I never hesitate to update my reviews if updated info would be helpful. And just a reminder, I do NOT receive compensation of ANY kind for my reviews."}

Has a &#34;universal&#34; tip as most things do this day and age... worked with my brand new LG G4 cell, my old rotary dial IPOD and my Kindle 8&#34; HDX.  It comes with 4 (2 sets) of extra ear cushions.  I feel that I have smallerish ears and I have a hard time finding earpods that are comfortable and will stay in.  These work great.  Comfortable and they have stayed in.  Mind you, I am NOT jogging with them in.  I only wish they'd come with a zipper case to hold them in for convenience.  At the price point, you'd think they would.  It does also have a microphone and I have &#34;tested&#34; that... worked. It has a little attachable pinch clip to keep in place as you move around. The foam tips are sort of like memory foam, but almost a bit softer really.  I think this both helps them stay in AND retain comfort.  The sound is very clean and clear - for an adult anyway.  The tips are cornflower blue if that matters to anyone... I think the pic is very clear and representative. I will update if there are any issues.<br \/>UPDATE: 6\/29\/2015 I have used these earbuds a number of times... one of the issues I have had in the past is that this &#34;shape&#34; of earbud doesn't want to stay in my ear... (tiny ears?) but these DO stay in.. I think it's the type of foam tip... seems to grip a bit better? To be fair, again, I am not jogging with them in... I am mostly in a sitting position using them. The &#34;flat&#34; wires really do help them not get all tangled... having stay that.. they also resist &#34;wrapping&#34; a bit too.  This is probably good. Otherwise you'd break the wires inside. The kiss of death to any wired accessory. Also, I've been informed that these are going to start coming with carry cases!!  Yup.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Ofiyaa P2 and the P2 Pro are worth every penny!","text":"Update! 4\/10\/22: My P2 Pro was found with a slight scratch in the screen deep enough to affect the picture quality. It shows as a tiny dark spot that draws the eye to it every time you look at the screen.  I contacted Aleceway first, then Amazon Customer Service who were both prompt to replace it. What I received was even better! New cables and they provided me a case to protect the screen.  Aleceway and Amazon are just amazing! So incredibly happy with these purchases!<br \/><br \/>Original review: The Ofiyaa P2 Pro is worth the money. At 13.3\" it matches my Lenovo ThinkPad T490 14\" screen perfectly. When showing both the P2 and P2 Pro to coworkers, they couldn't really tell a difference from the 12\" Ofiyaa P2 and the 13.3\" P2 Pro. Everyone who has seen these at my office have mentioned how awesome they are. Once again, I'm the cool kid with the cool toys.<br \/><br \/>I also own the Ofiyaa P2 12\" screen and both of these tri-screens work perfectly when I need to travel,  rest in bed and work, or just need the extra screen real estate while sitting in a conference room or the couch. Super versatility with having it attached to my laptop or even using it as an external, separate screen. I seriously recommend these products!<br \/><br \/>I have also been able to try this on other laptops like the Lenovo Thinkbook, the Lenovo X1 Carbon and these items perform perfectly every time! For my Microsoft Surface, which is more of a tablet style laptop, I use it as a separate screen.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I do like the P2 Pro for the connection features, as well as the changes in how it sets on the monitor. The 12\" P2 is a little bit lighter in weight, but both are portable connected to the laptop or carried separately. This is an amazing solution to needing an external monitor where it is just not feasible to carry one or set one up.<br \/><br \/>In addition, I also recommend purchasing from the company Aleceway as they are awesome in communication and customer service. Both items were purchased from them and each time they were very quick to provide communication and shipping expectations."}

That being said looking at the moon is pretty cool. I really can\u2019t ding it to much for quality. Some of the cheapest glass lenses are 4 times the cost of this. The instructions are very helpful but it\u2019s easy enough to figure out. The laser site didn\u2019t work at first on mine, noticed when i pushed the battery cover it started work so I had to tape the battery tighter and it started working. Overall a decent value telescope. if you\u2019re excepting more you\u2019ll need to look elsewhere."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent Padded Leather \"Rotational\" Case With Automatic Wake\/Sleep Feature","text":"This MARWARE REVOLVE CASE for the 8.9\" Kindle Fire HD has a hard interior frame that grips the tablet securely--once you click the tablet in, it won't be falling out again by accident!  (But if you need to remove the tablet from the case, it comes out fairly easily.)<br \/><br \/>The genuine leather cover is smooth (with some visible but attractive grain) and is lightly padded.  A narrow elastic band holds the cover closed as needed.  This case should provide good protection if your tablet is carried in a bag or tote with other items, is lightly jolted, or is dropped for only a few inches.  (I don't think that anything will protect a large tablet from damage if it is truly dropped.)<br \/><br \/>The case has a built-in stand that solidly supports the 8.9\" Kindle Fire at three different viewing angles, in either portrait (vertical) or landscape (horizontal) orientation.  An interior frame rotates to change the orientation, but it takes two hands and a bit of effort to change from landscape to portrait, or back.  (The same is true of other \"rotational\" tablet cases that I've looked at.)<br \/><br \/>A tab on the interior frame fits solidly into one of the three deep slots in the cover to  change the viewing angle.  The frame holds the viewing angle firmly without easily allowing the tablet to fall flat.  However, the viewing angles are rather steep, so that only the third slot provides a comfortable viewing angle for me in either portrait or landscape orientation.  (I mostly use my tablet on a tabletop, with a stylus, so need a fairly shallow viewing angle.)<br \/><br \/>An automatic wake\/sleep feature turns the big tablet on or off when you open or close the cover.  (When the tablet turns on, you must swipe the \"unlock\" ribbon, or the tablet will turn off again.)  This wake\/sleep feature works with both landscape orientations (with the camera on the left or on the right), which is important if you frequently rotate the tablet from portrait to landscape and back.<br \/><br \/>The wide elastic band inside the front cover had me baffled--until I read the product description to find it what it is for.  However, this \"hand strap\" does in fact work very well for holding your weighty tablet in portrait position for reading if you don't have a flat surface available for the stand.<br \/><br \/>Overall, this is an excellent high-quality case.  It's expensive, but if you want the rotational feature and\/or a padded leather cover (both features add some bulk), it's a good choice.  Another very nice, less expensive case that I like a little better because it has a wider selection of shallower viewing angles, is the [[ASIN:B009X0167Y Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 8.9\", Black]]."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Works with my 14\u201d Laptop; 10.1\u201dFire Tablet, & 12.9\u201d iPad Pro; not good w\/devices over 14\u201d","text":"This stand is perfect for my needs as I do not plan to carry it around. In 2018, I ordered a [[ASIN:B07HBQSCM3\u00a0Boyata Laptop Holder]] and love it. It has been working well for almost 2-years of\u00a0daily\u00a0use with my\u00a014\" LG Laptop. The Boyata will hold up to a 17\" laptop. However, I wanted another stand to use for my \"smaller footprint\" tablets, so I decided on this one.<br \/><br \/>First of all, this collapses to a compact footprint as shown in the first few photos. Second, there is no assembly required. It is stylish (I love the flame cutouts) and simple. It arrives in a collapsed state and takes some strength to pull apart and move it into a desired angle.<br \/><br \/>I can adjust this to the angle that is most comfortable for me. I can also use this to angle my screen and also use a separate keyboard and mouse (which I can store underneath when not in use). This fits my 14\" LG Notebook, my 12.9\" iPad Pro, and my 10.1\" Fire Tablet. It is not suitable for devices over 14\". Although the Amazon page says it will work with 15.6\" laptops, I do not recommend it as my 14\" laptop hangs over each edge by 2.5\" each side.<br \/><br \/>The anti-skid silicone pads on the bottom ensure that this does not slip around on my desk. The open flame design provides an opening for air circulation so the device does not overheat.<br \/><br \/>Only time will tell if the \"hinges\" on this stand will last and not collapse. I suppose if one changes the position of the stand daily, that this may not be so sturdy. Nevertheless, so far I love it for my purpose as I will be using this with my 12.9\" iPad Pro or other smaller tablets I have. If it should fail in any way, I will update my review.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I do feel this is a nice non-portable stand option for laptops or notebooks under 14\". I would not put anything above that size on this despite what the Amazon site says. The current price of $34.99 minus 30% brings the cost of this stand down to $24.50 which is exceptionally reasonable considering my other stand was $50."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Disguises Kindle Keyboard, 1st Gen Kindle Fire, or Nexus 7 as Beautiful Book","text":"[[VIDEOID:mo4US5M5XC9DUY]]This case, the VERSO PROLOGUE (MARBLED BLUE),  is so pretty, I'm going to use it for my Kindle Keyboard even though it doesn't fit quite as well as the case I've been using (the [[ASIN:B003DZ165W Kindle Lighted Leather Cover, Black (Fits Kindle Keyboard)]] ).  Because the Verso cover is designed to fit a number of e-readers, and the Kindle Keyboard is the thinnest, the cover's \"book spine\" is a little wider than I'd like.  But the spine itself is fun, showing a gold-stamped book title,\"Verso II\".<br \/><br \/>I tried this case with all of my small e-readers:  the 1st Gen Kindle Fire, the Kindle Keyboard, and the Nexus 7.  As you can see from the accompanying video slide show, the case works (or as the manufacturer would say, \"is compatible with\") all three.  However, depending on the device, you may have to adjust the elastic bands so that they don't cover important keys or buttons.<br \/><br \/>The best fit is with the 1st Gen Kindle Fire.  The device's power button and ports are at the center bottom, and the ambient light sensor is at the upper left corner, so the case's elastic bands interfere with nothing. The Kindle Keyboard is a good fit.  The case's elastic bands come close to covering the outside keyboard keys at the lower left and right, but the bands can be pushed back for clearance; and the bands don't interfere with the Keyboard's power button on the lower edge. The Nexus 7 (which is slightly larger than the Fire, and slightly thicker than the Keyboard) is a snug fit, but the case still works.  The elastic band at the top right must be pushed back to clear the Nexus 7 power and volume buttons located on the side  edge at the top right.  Although the case covers the Nexus 7 speaker on the back, the sound is the same whether the tablet is in or out of the case.<br \/><br \/>Once adjusted, the elastic bands stay in place, because there is a rubbery material on the underside of the elastic that grips the surface beneath it. (I have screen protector film on my Kindle Fire and Nexus 7, which seems like a good idea whenever a case holds the e-reader by elastic bands instead of a hard plastic shell.)  This Verso case lacks any elastic closure, magnetic closure, or automatic wake\/sleep feature.  However, the case stays closed fairly well (like a book), and offers good protection if your device is placed carefully (not tossed) into a bag or tote.  There is a pocket on the inside cover that is supposedly for \"important papers\", but it only holds a few thin items.  Apparently you can use this pocket to hold your e-reader when the cover is folded back.<br \/><br \/>According to the retail literature that comes with it, the Verso Prologue Marbled Blue case is \"compatible\" with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Keyboard, Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0), NOOK, Kobo Wi-Fi, Kobo Vox, Sony Reader Daily Edition, Sony Reader Wi-Fi, BlackBerry Playbook, HTC Flyer, Dell Streak 7, and other 7\" tablets (e.g., the Nexus 7).  This case is extremely well made, using superior materials, and makes your e-reader look like a beautiful handmade book."}

I also liked the fact that the cable is wrapped in braided nylon, so it seems very durable so it doesn't seem like it will kink up or easily wear out.  It claims fast changing capability, but I am not sure that it charged my smartphone any faster than any other cable.  The only downside that I can see at all is that this cable is rather pricey.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Fast; comes in a nice case","text":"This is an impressive little drive and operates quite fast on USB 3.  No install or drivers needed as it is ready to use; just plug in the provided USB cable and it is ready to go.  It might be a little pricey, but not much more expensive than typical USB sticks of the same capacity (256 MB).  It doesn't seem to provide you much more value than a regular USB stick, at least not in terms of storage space.  The value is in the speed.  It is quite heavy compared to a USB stick and about 2 to 3 times larger, as it is encased in metal, so probably far more durable than some storage devices.  The size is still small, at 4 inches long, 1 3\/4 inches wide and 1\/2 inch thick.  It also comes in an attractive metal storage case that would be great for transporting it.  This would be an ideal external drive for your data.  You can then detach it and move it to another computer easily, just by unplugging the USB cable.  If you are traveling, it should travel quite safely in the metal storage box it comes in.  The capacity is a little low by today's standards, but larger solid state drives do get expensive.  This would be ideal in a 1 TB or larger size and I think we will see bigger solid states drives in the future at affordable prices.  I would not hesitate to recommend this if 256MB space is large enough for your needs.  This would also be great as an off-site backup."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Premium, crisp and clear, high-performance surround sound but Bluetooth capability must be purchased separately","text":"I was always impressed with the room filling &#34;surround&#34; sound of my boyfriend's two Bose wave units. In my opinion, this system delivers that same quality audio I am used to hearing.<br \/><br \/>Besides the tabletop unit, a slim remote control, demo CD, power cord, and instructions are included in the box.<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/><br \/>- Setup is exceptionally easy.<br \/><br \/>- The sleek design has no visible buttons.<br \/><br \/>- The slim intuitive remote is operable from up to twenty feet away. It worked for me even when the unit was not within sight. The battery is included and installed.  Battery replacement requires a CR2032 or DL2032 3-volt lithium button cell battery<br \/><br \/>- It has a touch top which provides the ability to tap the top center part of the console to turn the unit on or off. Of course, those with animals might find the unit being toggled on and off by their furry companions.<br \/><br \/>- There is excellent surround sound which comes through crisp and clear. The radio required optimal placement in my house in order to receive the stations without minimal static. I actually have both AM and FM antennas on order.<br \/><br \/>- It has a sleek design and beautiful espresso black color.<br \/><br \/>- It has an integrated AM\/FM tuner and the front display displays the text of music playing.<br \/><br \/>- It has a CD player that also plays MP3 music files recorded on a CD-R \/ CD-RW discs. I played an MP3 CD fine. In my case, only the names of the songs were displayed at the beginning of each song followed by only the track for the remainder of the play. I suspect this has something to do with the way this CD was recorded.  There are also different play modes available when playing an audio CD such as normal play, shuffle repeat, repeat track, etc. (NOTE: The CD player is not for use with mini-CDs.)<br \/><br \/>- There are two alarms available.<br \/><br \/>- There are 6 presets for AM and 6 presets for FM available and are simple to program.<br \/><br \/>-There is an auxiliary input to enable playback from an audio device and a headphone jack for private listening. The audio through the headphones is as crisp, clear, and smooth as without headphones.<br \/><br \/>- A demo CD is included that wonderfully demonstrates the sound range.<br \/><br \/>- The digital clock and LED display is easily readable.<br \/><br \/>- Most system settings are permanently maintained even during a power outage or if the system is unplugged with the exception that the clock time is maintained for only 48 hours in backup memory during a power outage.<br \/><br \/>- It has a sleep timer from 10 to 90 minutes. It remembers the last sleep setting that was set and increments up from that.<br \/><br \/>- I called Bose twice asking pre-purchase questions about the Bluetooth options and also about an AM antenna recommendation (the Terk AM Advantage). Each time they answered quickly and were very helpful. The number for Bose is in the comments section of this review.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/><br \/>- An optional $99 Bluetooth adapter needs to be purchased to wirelessly stream music, movie sound, etc. from smartphone, tablet, laptop, or other Bluetooth device. I ordered the [[ASIN:B007ZG03DG Bose Wave Bluetooth Music Adapter]] and plugged it into the Bose Link port to test their optional adapter. Adding the additional Bluetooth adapter takes away from the sleek design and increases the footprint of the unit as a result of have to attach an extra component. Since this external adapter can only pair one Bluetooth device at a time, I had to turn the Bose on, then press AUX to cycle it to Bluetooth. Once there, I pressed the 5 button to make it discoverable.  Since it remembers the last device I paired, I did not have to make it discoverable again. However, if I wanted to pair a new device, I had to press the 6 key until the unit beeped (about 10 seconds) and then it would clear the Bluetooth memory and become discoverable again. One negative I did see with the external adapter is that the volume is about half that with Bluetooth enabled.  What I mean by this is that a volume of 30 on the radio sounds like 15 when paired with Bluetooth. I found that I had to double the volume when using the Bose Bluetooth adapter I purchased.<br \/><br \/>- No AM or FM antenna is included. This is not a terrible CON as for most people antennas should not be needed. I live in northwestern NJ and could not receive any AM stations until I moved the unit toward the window. I went to the Bose store and the fellow there said the power cord acts as the AM antenna (the manual did not say this). He suggested I call Bose directly. When I did call, they recommended the [[ASIN:B000069EUW Terk Indoor AM Antenna ADVANTAGE]].  I also ordered a [[ASIN:B00ZXI2MJG FM Antenna Male with 3.5 Jack Adapter]] for the FM radio. I will update this review with the results of both antennas once I receive and test them.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this tabletop Bose wave music system provides premium, crisp and clear, high-performance surround sound. However, Bluetooth capability should be both integrated into the unit and standard. The absence of integrated Bluetooth with this wave system is like buying a cook pot without an attached handle and having to purchase a &#34;detachable&#34; handle separately. Although most people will not require an antenna for radio reception, that might be a required purchase for some. I actually had to spend $152.10 for the additional Bluetooth and the two antennas.  At a minimum, most people will have to shell out $640 (with tax) just to have a Bluetooth enabled system.  If antennas are also needed, the full purchase price will be about $687.  If this Bose unit had integrated Bluetooth, I would have rated this five stars. Despite the lack of Bluetooth, the incredible Bose sound comes through loud and clear.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 9\/24\/2015 - I received the [[ASIN:B000069EUW Terk Indoor AM Antenna ADVANTAGE]] and tried it &#34;wirelessly&#34; (meaning in proximity of without the wired connection) with this Bose and it did not work to improve AM reception at all when I dialed into the stations on the antenna. I also tried it wirelessly on my [[ASIN:B013G6TMUS ION Block Rocker Bluetooth Portable Speaker System IPA76C]] and on another older system I had and it also did not work. Instead I wound up wiring this to the AM ports on the back of my older system (not a Bose) and only then did this AM antenna work. Unfortunately, I found this use for this Bose because I did not see a way to &#34;wire&#34; it to the music system. (For those who are interested, the link to my review of this antenna is in the comments section of this review.)<br \/><br \/>UPDATE 9\/25\/2015 - I received the  [[ASIN:B00ZXI2MJG FM Antenna Male with 3.5 Jack Adapter]] for the FM radio today and plugged it into the FM antenna port on the Bose. No matter how I manipulated this FM antenna, it did nothing to increase reception of the FM stations. Unfortunately, this antenna purchase was useless for me as well and very disappointing."}

My tech savvy husband first tried to download the suggested app. He was unable to find the right one for his Android phone. There's a slot for an SD card, but it uses large SD cards which aren't as common anymore, so we didn't have any. It does allow for a flash drive to be inserted, so that's how we are using it. The picture quality is pretty good. We have been using high resolution pictures on it, so if you use lower resolution ones, it may not look as nice.

I only used the webcam cover.<br \/><br \/>It is easy to apply the cover by just peeling the full lining off the bottom of the cover and sticking on. I like that it has a great sticking area.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good Camera, but Probably Not Worthy of its Pricepoint and Place in the Canon lineup.","text":"I've been trying out how to review this camera for a while, trying hard to really love this camcorder but I'm having some problems.  Undoubtably, this is a very good camcorder, but I feel that it is lacking.  To start with, why would you sell a $900 camcorder that cannot do 4K it just seems like it is being sold pre-obsolete.  I understand that the SD technology that it uses to store footage might be a bottle neck, but why release such a high level camera at this price point and not have it current?  Also, this camcorder abandoned wifi which its predecessor had at the same price point.<br \/><br \/>As far as actual functionality, I took this to Costa Rica on a family trip as well as some birdwatching and I got some truly wonderful footage and some truly unusable footage.  Perhaps I should say what kind of user I am.  I am an advanced amateur photographer using Canon DSLR's and L glass lenses.  So I am not new to Canon or photography, but I am new to videography, and there is a learning curve.  Where I can put my subject in the lense quite easily with a hand held, or even tripod mounted camera, I wasted tons of time and opportunities trying to find the subject.  The video screen was nearly impossible to use due to glare and I constantly found myself zooming out to get a rough idea where I was pointing and then zooming in on my subject.<br \/><br \/>The Autofocus was also a mixed bag.  I loved the touch screen focusing but I found that the focus would keep losing the subject and searching for focus.  It was impossible to override if there was brush in the way and manual focus was painful.  When it worked, I got a lot of sharp footage, when it didn't I could not even tell with the small screen, especially in low light, I found that I had missed a lot of focuses on long shots of birds in the canopy.<br \/><br \/>As for build, it took a moderate amount of abuse in the jungles and kept working  sound was good and when I got the subject in the lense and in focus, I was very happy with the results.  I can't blame all these problems on the camera, I have to take my responsibility in a lot of the bad shots.  But sometimes it seemed like the film quality had kind of a news gathering camera quality rather than cinematic (yes, I set it to cinematic.)  It seems like the controls are minimal almost to point and shoot which is good, but sometimes to override.<br \/><br \/>So after all this, why four stars?  I actually really like this camera. I do have some incredible footage and memories.  I'm glad it is in my toolkit, I just think it could be and should be better at this price point."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"cord tamer stick on clips","text":"Purchased these to tame a few cords... I placed them directly on my baseboard - which would be fine, but my old house has a rounded baseboard... flat have worked better - but even still it's works.  I put a satellite cable and an old school land line phone line in it with room to spare.  The sticky back seems to hold even on the slightly rolled surface and is keeping the cords off the floor so the robo vac doesn't become entangled.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Awesome Dash cam! Love it.","text":"I really like this dash cam. The video quality is great, it comes with an optional  rear camera, and is straightforward to set up. The front camera has a wide FOV (170\u02da), so you can see the entire road in front of you.<br \/><br \/>There are lots of settings to customize your recordings: you have the option to do either 2160p (4k) @ 30 fps, 1440p @ 60fps of 1080p @ 240 fps (!). You can choose to record audio, have timestamps on the video, how long you want to recording loop to be (1, 3, or 5 min), GPS stamps, speed stamps, etc. If you turn on the GPS recording, you can see a map of where you were driving from a PC\/Mac.<br \/><br \/>The camera also has a \"G Sensor\" setting so that if the camera detects a collision, it will automatically lock and save the video. There is also a parking setting that will record a time lapse while parked (which I have not tried). I think you may need another accessory for the parking recording--I'm not sure.<br \/><br \/>IMPORTANT: You need your own SD card, because this doesn't come with one. I would definitely recommend an \"endurance\" that is built to handle constant writing\/rewriting that comes with dash cam recordings. The maximum size this dash cam can use is 256gb I believe.<br \/><br \/>Overall, I'm a big fan. An easy recommendation if you are looking for a dash cam."}

Note: CHARGING CORD IS NOT INCLUDED, so if you are buying as a gift make sure you include a charging cord (what you use for your cell phone is the type you need). ALSO, it is not ready to use out of the box so you might want to charge it before gifting it.  FYI - the speaker can be used while it\u2019s charging - 3 hour charge time from empty to full, it's also best to charge from an outlet rather than your computer.  Lastly, the powerful Voice prompts volume cannot be adjusted.<br \/><br \/>FYI, it does NOT support flash memory, it does have a USB port but it is only for using the battery to charge another device like a phone and not for playing music (which would have been great).  It comes with an AUX port so I will be using it with my iPod in addition to wirelessly (100 ft Range) with my phone or tablet.
