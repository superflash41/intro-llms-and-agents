{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good Laptop for the Price","text":"My son is going to college next year so we decided it was time to update his laptop. He mainly uses it for gaming (Steam), but also uses it for school work. He says the track pad is a little on the large side for his preference. Battery life is good. It's noticeably faster than his older laptop which was 3 years old. Overall he is pleased with it's performance so far. Hopefully this will get him through college."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent laptop bag with room for expansion; fits my 14\u201d laptop with room to spare","text":"This laptop bag is very nice. In fact I am impressed. It comes with a carry strap that can be hooked on the diagonal on the bag. It also has handles. The handle covers are not great but they are good enough. In fact, I wish the handle covers were made of the same material as the interior of the laptop pocket because that would have been better. This is the only thing I do not like about this bag.<br \/><br \/>FEATURES<br \/>- One outside folder pocket by the ZINZ label<br \/><br \/>- On the opposite side, there is another folder pocket by the handle and one zippered pocket underneath the horizontal strap<br \/><br \/>- The main compartment has a Velcro strap over the folder pocket that is padded. This is where the laptop goes.<br \/><br \/>- Besides the thin central compartment that will hold a couple of folders or some papers, there are four folder-type pockets of various sizes and one tiny folder-type pocket that will hold a pen or pencil.<br \/><br \/>- If more room is needed, there is an expanded section that can be unzipped and which has a lot of room (three to four inches of capacity). Inside that expanded compartment are small mesh folder pockets (two on one side and three on the other).<br \/><br \/>In summary, this is a great laptop bag. It is well made and the zippers open and close easily. The laptop sleeve is softly padded and protective. The bag's worst feature is the plasticky or PU leather-like handle covers. That is the only thing I do not like as the handles are not as comfortable to carry for a long time as they could be. Although there is no current price listed, I would expect this to be priced between $25 and $30."}

Compared to most tablets it's kind of slow, the screen resolution isn't good, and the app choice is limited.  However it's large, sounds very good and works great as a TV with the Verizon FIOS app.  But it loses a star for battery life.  I streamed one 2:10 movie on wi-fi and the battery went down from 89% to 20%.<br \/><br \/>Much like an iPhone, it comes with numerous blah Amazon apps that can't be deleted, but you can hide them all away in a folder.  It comes registered to you out of the box so just connect to wi-fi to get started.  The 16GB version has about 12.5 gigs of actual usable memory, but it also has a slot for a microSD card if needed."}

Long story short, he was very dismayed to have to find a replacement.  After several weeks and research, winding down options to about 1\/2 a dozen backpacks - he chose this one.  He reports a few things...<br \/>PROS:  1.  it's well made - well above the price. And a long shot from the cost of the over expensive backpack that was stolen.  2.  It's roomy.  3.

It is entirely possible you could overload it and make it very, very heavy....<br \/>A couple of further notes.... he has not evaluated the charging aspects of the bag.. there are spots you can pull a USB cord through to attach to your devices...

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A Sturdy and Well-Designed Collapsible Trunk Organizer","text":"My wife, like many women, is obsessed with organization.  When she saw the collapsible trunk box that came with our Mini Clubman she needed one for the Jeep.  So when I got a chance to get Thule Trunk Organizer from Amazon Vine I jumped at it.<br \/><br \/>I have long been familiar with Thule for their car racking products, so I knew this organizer would not be cheap, neither in construction or price. And this organizer falls right in with the rest of their product line; it is ruggedly constructed, carefully designed, and a little over-priced. This is a quality product but the 39.99 list price seems a little steep for what is essentially a twenty-first century basket.<br \/><br \/>Collapsed, the organizer is just a fraction of an inch tall, almost flush with the floor. Once the supporting wire side supports are in place the frame forms a sturdy and rigid basket.  My wife found the process of popping it up to be a little less than obvious, but it is pretty straightforward. It does take a little muscling to set the side wires but this also insures that it does not collapse accidentally or at a mere jostling. Once set up, and the wires pushed into their proper place, the organizer is very sturdy.<br \/><br \/>I was a little worried about ordering it without a clear idea of its size. 41 Liters  is a little less than a 10 gallon aquarium which at least gave me a ballpark idea.  To make it a little easier to visualize, I posted a photo with a milk carton and grocery bag.<br \/><br \/>I do wish there was some way to give it a shoulder strap.  It can carry quite a bit, but due to the design that puts a handle on each side, it must be carried with two hands. So, if you have it filled with groceries, it will need it's own dedicated trip from the car to the kitchen. It would be nice if there were a way to carry it with one hand.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>Rugged Construction<br \/>Quality Materials<br \/>Thoughtful, functional design<br \/>Collapsed size is very small<br \/>Attractive<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>A little pricey<br \/>No shoulder or one handed way to carry.<br \/><br \/>Overall, a great and flexible organizer for a trunk or cargo area."}

We bought it for child safety reasons, wanted to know when our little one leaves his room, so it's pretty useless at this point--a false sense of security is worse than having no alarm at all. The first set we purchased worked well for about a year, than began malfunctioning in the manner described above.

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Isn't ideal","text":"I appreciate the seller's desire to sell a cheaper alternative to the GoPro-branded suction cup. However, there's a reason it's cheaper. The suction cup on this product seems to be too small to support the weight of the GoPro. The first time I tried testing it on my mirror, it fell after about 5-10 seconds. Also, the long arm separating the GoPro from the actual suction cup part is so long that the GoPro is susceptible to shaking when in a bumpy situation. Spend the extra money and get the GoPro-branded one"}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Slow Initial Charge; Odd Setup; Wildly Inaccurate Initial Location","text":"This SAMSUNG SMARTTHINGS TRACKER [SM-V110AZWAATT] is designed for wide-area GPS tracking.  That is, you set a home location, and then when you travel away from home, the SmartThings app can show you on a street map where the device is currently located.  I wanted something for in-home tracking of an oft-misplaced set of keys, and this is the wrong device for that purpose.<br \/><br \/>Since I was already using the SmartThings app to control my TV with Alexa, it was fairly simple to add the Tracker to the app, and to register it.  I was surprised to learn that the Tracker came with one year of free tracking service (provided by something called ziptracker, I think), which presumably means that one has to pay for the service after that.<br \/><br \/>My experience with the SmartThings app is that it is quirky, and it proved so again during setup.  Even though I began the Tracker device setup on my iPad, the setup process switched on its own to my Samsung Galaxy cellphone.  Go figure.<br \/><br \/>SmartThings registered my Tracker with the service, but when I sent a signal to record the Tracker\u2019s current location, the location was far, far off.  The map showed the Tracker to be in a wholly different neighborhood from my actual home!<br \/><br \/>Probably the wildly inaccurate initial location was caused by the signal\u2019s reporting from a Comcast or Verizon broadcast tower located in that spot--I\u2019ve had trouble using other locator services (e.g., Find My iPhone) for this reason.  However, the inaccurate location makes me wonder how useful the device would be for tracking children or pets.<br \/><br \/>One final complaint about the device is that it took a couple of hours for the initial charge.  I don\u2019t know how often it requires recharging. (My Tracker went straight into the hazardous waste recycle bin.)<br \/><br \/>NOTE:  I\u2019ve had some success at finding the oft-misplaced keys with [[ASIN:B0732P113R TrackR Pixel]].  It has a reasonably loud location signal, and a battery that lasts fairly well, so that the battery isn\u2019t always dead when I need to locate the keys."}

Let\u2019s face it, finding outlets on the go is no fun, packing excess cords and wall butts (not sure the real name, our house calls plug in part to the wall.. a wall butt!) which frequently get forgotten and left behind.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Portable Alternative to Earplugs That Delivers Decent Sound","text":"When playing background music, I'm not fussy about sound quality, but the built-in speakers on a Kindle or an MP3 player leave a lot to be desired.  I don't like wearing earplugs, so this portable device is the perfect solution.<br \/><br \/>The stereo speakers deliver decent, full sound, and are in a 2-1\/2\" by 10\" case that is easy to pick up and carry around the house.  The speaker cable (which can be stored inside the device) simply plugs into the earphone outlet of any player.  Unfortunately, the speaker cable extends only 13\" from the device, so it's a little short if you want to hold a Kindle in your hands while listening.  However, it's fine if you want to set your Kindle on a tabletop while listening, and it doesn't get tangled up if you're using the stereo system with a small MP3 player.<br \/><br \/>When I tested this portable stereo system with an audio book on a [[ASIN:B004HZYA6E Kindle Keyboard]], the sound quality was improved, but the maximum volume was quite a bit lower than the volume delivered by the built-in Keyboard speakers.  When I tested the device with a [[ASIN:B0051VVOB2 Kindle Fire]], both sound quality and maximum volume were better than the sound from the built-in Fire speakers.  When I tested the device with a [[ASIN:B004M8ST5O Philips GoGear Ariaz MP3 Player]], the sound quality could be adjusted to a rich, full sound by using the player's sound settings, and the maximum volume was much higher than that of the player's built-in speakers.  Obviously, the sound delivered by this portable stereo system will vary depending on what you plug it into.<br \/><br \/>The speakers are powered by four AA batteries (not included), or you can use the included USB cable to plug the device into another powered device, such as a computer.  The AmazonBasics device has an external on\/off switch and volume control.  For less than $20, this portable stereo sound system device delivers all the sound that I need for everyday listening, and it makes me very happy!"}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Smells like gasoline! Going back!","text":"First & most offensive: they reek of gasoline so if you are sensitive\/allergic to petroleum products like I am you will want to pass on these.  Second: the phone adapter is useless as-is. Mine was not drilled far enough to be able to tighten it into place for my iPhone 12 max. It just slipped & slid all over. Stupid me putting the adapter together first without picking up the binoculars to smell them bc I wasted 15 minutes trying to figure out how to put the adapter together bc it does not come with instructions!  I had to come back here to the website which was a total pain. Third: the tripod is also useless. I would not trust the iOS to hold my $1600 phone nor even a Mattel Barbie for that matter. It\u2019s just inefficient for the job imo.  Third: in order to try to give an honest review I did don gloves & eyewear to check the binoculars out.  They seemed average except for mine seemed to be missing about 10% of the film costing in the lower edge of one of the lenses which would have ruined every video & photograph unplanned to take so for me these are a very huge hard pass.  I expect the accessories that come with the main product to be as good or better than the product I\u2019m buying. Otherwise I would just buy the product as a stand alone.  Sadly, I found a decent pair of binoculars last year with a much better quality phone adapter & tripod, but they had a defect too.  Guess I\u2019m going to have to pay more.  Ugh."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"Awesome quality!","text":"Wow! The best things really do come in small packages! This little speaker packs a punch. The sound quality is amazing and I have since purchased more for use in the house over my Alexa (which I retuned). They are super durable too and mine has withstood the wear and tear of outside, being dropped in water numerous times, plastered in mud and dust at a worksite. It's a great little bit of kit. My only complaint is the battery seems to run out after about four hours which when you work outside isn't great as dont always have a plug handy. Otherwise for in the house it's great!"}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Compact Attractive, Quiet Unit","text":"Several reviewers mentioned the difficulty in setting this up.  It really wasn't that bad.  The steps were pretty easy, at least on my system.  The biggest issue I had was notifying my firewall that the software that was needed to map a drive for the unit was okay to run.  There is no mention of firewall interference in the small quick install manual, but the Seagate on-line help is excellent and I was able to find the answer quickly.  It was a bit confusing on how to identify the unit to the firewall, but I finally did get it set up.  There were 3 pre-built folders on the unit: Download, Public and Wiki.  I haven't yet figured out what Download and Wiki are for (or been able to access them), but the one called \"Public\" seems to contain most of the storage space and I was copying files to the unit in no time at all.  The unit doesn't seem very fast, but that could in part be the speed of my network.  You can use it with USB as an extension drive to one PC, rather than on a network, if you wish.<br \/><br \/>The fact that the install disk was a DVD threw me for a bit.  I had expected a CD, but some vendors now use DVDs instead of CDs for install programs.<br \/><br \/>I was a little annoyed that I had to go through a complete registration process before the software install would proceed.  When I went to a second PC and the registration process started again, I was more annoyed, but did discover that you can cancel out of the registration.  It wasn't that obvious the first time through, so I guess they really want you to register.<br \/><br \/>You do need to know that by default the drive is configured for Raid-1 (mirroring), which means that you only have 2 terabytes of space; not 4.  The second drive is used to mirror the first.  You can switch it to Raid-0 and get the whole 4 terabytes, but then there is no redundancy, so if either drive fails you are out of luck and you lose all your data.  With Raid-1, theoretically you can replace the failing drive (if only one fails at a time) and the system will rebuild the data.  I haven't yet discovered how to change the drive setting from Raid-1 to Raid-0.<br \/><br \/>This is a very compact, quiet unit.  It's totally black except for blue lights on the front that show power, status and drive activity.<br \/><br \/>I did not try the included backup program, as I prefer to use my own backup procedures.<br \/><br \/>Only time will tell if the unit stands up well or not.  Seagate used to make the very best drives, but other companies surpassed them, at least for a time.<br \/><br \/>This is a nice unit for the price and I'm happy to have it."}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Decent Sound, Less than Perfect Solution and Support","text":"I was very excited to get this radio. Wireless sounded perfect until I realized that wireless meant that the speaker wires were traded for seperate power cords for each speaker.  Which is a little troublesome because needing to find available power outlets is more difficult than placing cable wires.  Ultimately the only good location I could find for the system was in my workshop which has outlets at each end of the workbench. (It works perfectly there, but again would work just as easily with speaker wires instead.)<br \/><br \/>When I first turned the system on I was very disappointed with the sound, but eventually found that it was set on a \"flat\" equalizer preset (not sure why they have a \"flat\" setting, might as well have \"muddy\" or \"sucky\") Once I figured that out and changed it to a rock or pop setting I was very pleased with the sound.  However after using them for a day, one speaker stopped working.  I could sync it with the base station, but no sound would come out.<br \/><br \/>I called the 1-800 customer line which is a recording requesting me to call a non-800 long distance line.  Feeling a little Baited and Switched, I called the number and spoke to a nice enough representative who said to just return the item to Amazon. There was no RMA option to work directly with the manufacturer.  So I was not impressed with their Customer Service.<br \/><br \/>Since this was a Amazon Vine reviewer item, no one at Amazon knew anything about how to return the device. So I was not feeling too satisfied with the quality of the product and had no way to return it for exchange.  So I took a close look and noticed that the front power light was off centered, so using a little Newtonian Physics and the base of my hand I gave it a firm whack on the side.  The sound started immediately.  It's needed a couple more whacks, but it seems to be in line now.<br \/><br \/>So, all in all, I am happy except that the ipod tray seems a little cheap, It uses up the power of three separate devices rather than one, and their customer service left me high and dry.  But the sound is pretty good and it fills my workshop well. But bear in mind, this was a free reviewer item.  If I had to pay for this, received a poorly constructed item and  such limited customer service, I would not have been very satisfied."}

Very easy to set up and we are Verizon Fios Customer and now you can grab a cable card from the Verizon shop or pay postal for it to be delivered to you.; now you can initiative the cable card on your own via the automated phone or website.  It took all of 15 minutes to activate the cable card!  Sooo easy.  no more making an appointment with a technician.<br \/><br \/>So with four tuners it means we can record four channels simultaneously, record one Internet program whilst watching a pre-recorded show!!  We were coming up with needing to record three programs and our two tuner TiVo couldn't cope!  So much storage that we don't need to buy an external hard drive to store the HD program that we have for our TiVo Series 3.<br \/><br \/>We love that out TiVo series three and Elite can talk to each other.  We notices if we started watching one program in one room, we can pick it up where we left off on the other TiVo! How cool is this.  The transfer replay quality is great as if your were watching it from the original TiVo that recorded the show.  Note that transfer is wireless and hence if you have N then it will be a lot quicker.<br \/><br \/>We love that the IPad has an app for TiVo and now I can search for programs to record without interrupting the program that we are watching.  How cool is that!  The new TiVo interface allows a smaller screen of the program that you are watching (top right of TV screen) whilst you are searching for shows to record or to search in 'my shows' that were previously recorded.<br \/><br \/>Didnt even think about it, we bought the lifetime license for it as most TiVo last about 7 to 8 years for us; so it really pays off for us.<br \/><br \/>Only wished they kept the clock on the front screen!"}

On my older 40\u201d Samsung Smart TV, the antenna recognizes 48 free HDTV broadcast stations (many are local advertising channels, of course) when set up in my downstairs living room.  Most of the broadcast channels display clear, non-pixelated pictures.<br \/><br \/>This is better performance than my previous favorite antenna (not amplified) which brought in about 43 stations with many pixelated displays, when set up in an upstairs bedroom with an old 26\u201d digital\/analog TV.  Because I live in a hilly area, upstairs is a far, far better location for any indoor antenna in my condo.  I was surprised that this antenna gets the San Jose NBC channel that is 51 miles away across many hills--the other antenna didn\u2019t pick up that channel at all.<br \/><br \/>The signal meter, which shows 1-3 (top-row) LED lights to indicate weak, good, or strong signals for each channel, is very useful for finding the best position and orientation of the antenna in a room.  I love the fact that this antenna can be mounted on a wall, can sit upright on a table (using the included stand), or can lie flat on a table.<br \/><br \/>The coaxial cable has a good, threaded connector that attaches the plug firmly to the TV antenna connector."}

There is a blue light to indicate that a port is on.  Not quite sure what I would need this feature for, but it is certainly unique and might be handy for something in the future.  The best part of this hub is that it is USB 3.0.  My computer has a limited number of USB 3.0 ports, so this allows me to expand one port into 6.  There is also a 7th port that appears to be just to be used as a charger port.  I do wish it has a few more ports, but that's the only thing I find lacking.  Being that this is a powered hub, it won't steal power from your system, so gives a lot of expansion capability to add USB devices."}
{"rating":5.0,"title":"My Second One","text":"I purchased the previous model before (the VS210) and got this one as a secondary\/travel unit. I mainly use this product for power point. I am very happy with the quality of this projector. It is easy to set up and use. (Though if you have a Mac, you'll need an extra adaptor to hook it up to your computer. It is an adaptor that goes from the VGA cord to a USB port on the Mac. Since I had a previous model, I already had the extra adaptor cord. I was able to take the VGA cord to an Apple store and get the adaptor cord.) The picture on this is good. We use it in a large room with windows and have no problems seeing the images and words on the screen despite the light. The colors are a bit muted on the screen, but do not change drastically. It is small enough to be portable and can be used on a number of computers. It has a built in stand, so no propping the projector up on books to get it to the right height. It does get hot, so make sure you don't set paper under it or near it while it is on."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Incorrect location of -_ (dash\/underscore) key a deal-breaker","text":"It helps to have small hands to use this small keyboard, and I almost got used to scrunching my hands together to type with it.  Until I needed to enter an underscore. The  -_ key should be located to the right of the 0 key.  Since high school that's where my right hand is trained to go for that key.  But on this keyboard it's two keys right of the space bar.  What????  Keyboard manufacturers really need to stop rearranging the keys we've all learned to locate on a standard keyboard layout. I know compromises sometimes need to be made for a small form factor, but this is really a deal-breaker for me, so I'm returning.  I also found the touchpad precision to be below average even after tinkering with the Windows mouse settings.  Ehhhhh.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE:  I checked the product photos, and in the first two pictures the -_ key is in the expected location, but in the next two pictures the -_ key is in the awkward location as it was in the keyboard I received.  Granted, on the box it says &#34;THE MANUFACTURER RESERVES THE RIGHT TO AMEND THE SPECIFICATIONS WITHOUT PRIOR NOTIFICATION.  THE PICTURES AND DATE IN THE STYLEBOOK ARE FOR CONSULT ONLY IF THERE IS FLUCTUATION...&#34;  (Not sure this is a &#34;right&#34;... sounds more like an &#34;adopted business practice&#34; to eschew product configuration management).

It also comes with a cable so you can connect it to your phone or device that way if you prefer, or if you don't have Bluetooth. The ear cups are really comfortable. The noise reduction seem really good, especially when compared to the earbuds that I was using before this. I am very pleased with how nice the sound quality is. For my purposes, it's excellent!

One needs to know.. for the price point this exceeds all expectations!! I do believe we need to keep expectations within reason\u2026 Not said as an excuse but, for what you\u2019re paying and getting the two are sound deal.

No extra purchase needed. (however, you must have a wall butt for usb cord to plug into socket.)<br \/><br \/>\u2022instructions are straight forward and easy to follow.

Otherwise, the sound bar remote cannot connect.<br \/><br \/>\u2022the actual USB cord is far to short for our outlet.. and may also be for most? this caused angst to reach the outlet.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Excellent Laptop","text":"I didn't buy mine here.  Wish I had.  At the time, after I ordered mine from NewEgg, I discovered Amazon had one through one of their partners for $120 less than I paid.  This laptop is blindingly fast, and remarkably cool considering that's an i7 processor perking away in there.  I loaded eight extra megs of RAM into mine for a total of twelve megs.  This is a great value for the price.  I love that you can set the touchpad so that it is disabled whenever you attach a mouse.  I'm forever bumping the touchpad when I type, and that bumps the cursor up into the middle of my document. With the Asus with a mouse attached, I don't have that problem.<br \/><br \/>Pros:  Value, speed, discreet Nvidia graphics card, ability to disable touchpad.<br \/><br \/>Cons:  I didn't find the cheaper one here until I'd already ordered elsewhere,  A fair amount of bloatware."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Doesn\u2019t Play Well With Unusual Router Setup","text":"Alas, this NETGEAR NIGHTHAWK MESH X4S WALL-PLUG TRI-BAND WIFI MESH EXTENDER (EX7500) doesn\u2019t play well with my wireless router setup.  For security reasons, I have the router set to allow only devices with specific MAC numbers to connect to my home network.<br \/><br \/>After I successfully linked the router and the mesh extender--so that the extender was showing four (4) solid blue lights to indicate linkage, with strong signals on both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz wireless bands--I discovered that any devices that automatically connected to the mesh extender network would end up being blocked from network  access by the router if they tried to reconnect to the network.  That meant I had to go into the router\u2019s settings to restore the devices\u2019 network and Internet access.<br \/><br \/>My guess is that the mesh extender assigns a temporary MAC number to the devices that join the mesh, and that these numbers aren\u2019t recognized later by the router, so that the router blocks the devices from the network (as it\u2019s supposed to do). This is only a guess as to what's actually going on, but I verified that if a device was walked out of the router\u2019s normal range, so that the extender probably took over, the device would be blocked out of the network later.<br \/><br \/>In addition, although the 4 blue lights indicated good mesh extender placement and signals, the extender didn\u2019t seem to provide the strong signal to my garage that I was hoping for.  A TP-Link range extender inside my garage provides a better signal, so I\u2019ll stick with it.  (Even though the TP-Link extender consumes bandwidth, I get around that issue by switching it off when I\u2019m not working in the garage.)  I didn\u2019t try the mesh extender inside the garage, because I don\u2019t have an open wall plug in the garage.<br \/><br \/>I love my Netgear Nighthawk routers, which are real workhorses.  They are rock solid, and my current Nighthawk model effortlessly handles more than 60 devices (though not all of them are connected all the time).  However, the mesh extender doesn\u2019t work for me.  It may be possible to solve the blocking problem, but after working with the extender for about 5 hours, I decided that my existing setup was good enough."}

{"rating":1.0,"title":"Recordings Are Stored in Canary Cloud; Full Replay Access Requires Paid Membership","text":"When I ordered this CANARY VIEW INDOOR 1080p HD SECURITY CAMERA (with Wide-Angle Lens, Motion\/Person Alerts, Works with Alexa, Pets\/Elder\/Baby Monitoring), there was one very important thing that I didn\u2019t understand.  To wit, the camera has zero internal storage--everything is uploaded to Canary Cloud, which costs $89 a year for full-featured camera access and video replays.<br \/><br \/>It is possible to set up the camera without signing up for a free 30-day trial membership (which requires entering a credit card that will automatically be charged after 30 days unless you cancel the membership).  You do this by accepting the $0.00 monthly charge option, and scrolling on down past the place where you enter the credit card info.<br \/><br \/>However, most of the playback and customizing features in the Canary app (the only way to access the camera) are inoperable without a membership.  When you\u2019re at home, you can \u201cWatch Live\u201d if you tinker with the available settings.  However, you can\u2019t play back motion events without a membership unless they happen while you\u2019re away--and you can\u2019t trick the camera into thinking you\u2019re away, because the app determines your location by the location of your tablet or smartphone.  (And you can\u2019t turn the phone off, because you need the app to access the camera.)<br \/><br \/>The camera sells for about $80 on Amazon, and that\u2019s a lot to pay for a device that\u2019s almost useless unless you add a \u201cmembership\u201d that costs another $89 a year.  Should the company go out of business, your device will, too.  Also, all of your recordings are stored in Canary Cloud, so you need to trust the company to keep the site secure and private.<br \/><br \/>As for the camera itself, it\u2019s fairly low resolution, but reasonably wide-angle.  Without the membership, the camera will works as a real-time spy camera for the room it\u2019s in (it does resemble an Amazon Echo).  The camera is fixed in one position, and only records what is directly in front, so you need to place it in a spot where it will cover as much area as possible.<br \/><br \/>When I think about it, I don\u2019t really need an indoor security camera, because my Comcast home security system monitors all the doors and windows of my condo.  Given that this device costs $89 a year, it makes more sense for me to add another camera to my existing system ($95) and then accept the extra Comcast monthly charge, so that I don\u2019t have to fool with the awkward Canary app settings."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"WORKS WELL; CONFIGURABLE","text":"This is the first switch that I have owned that can be configured.  That's a big plus.  Once you determine the IP address of the switch, you simply enter it in your browser, enter the default password (which you can change) and you are into the setup program that is internal to the switch.  You can do individual settings for each of the 8 ports, if you know what the settings mean (I didn't.)  This is an optional thing; you can use the switch without any configuration; just plug it in and it is ready to go.  There are two reasons why I didn't give this a 5 star rating.  1) The indicator lights showing active ports are on the same side as the cables.  Since I want cables to go out the back, I can't see the lights with the switch facing me.  My prior switch had lights on one side and cables went out the other.  In all honesty, I can't say that the lights ever provided much benefit and could be distracting, so this might be an advantage to some people to have both lights and cables on the back.  What's the point of the lights if you can't see them, unless you want the cables facing you?  2) In order to register the switch and get a program to determine the IP address of the switch (so that you can configure it), you have to use a mobile device (a smart phone) and install the Netgear Insight application and set up a Netgear account.  Strange that you need to use a device other than a computer to do this and it is rather a nuisance.  Apparently there is no Windows version of Netgear Insight.  You have to use your IOS or Android device.  Another problem I had is that you supposedly can change your password on your device, which I tried, but apparently the password did not meet the requirements, but was never informed of that by the program.  I was able to change the password on the device after getting into it via the IP address.  Netgear makes good products and I have purchased other Netgear products in the past with good results.  This is another quality product, so if the placement of the lights doesn't bother you, I would recommend it, especially if you need individually configurable ports."}

I know, I cannot be the only one out there so, maybe this well help those who don\u2019t speak tech- and just want to know, you know.. the downlow!!? I was gifted a Mac by my fam. for the purpose to do my ABC\u2019s of life- email, online shopping, bills, movie streaming and travel accessibility.. but, soon after receiving I noticed the lack of charging and multi tasking I could do powered off of my new laptop-<br \/><br \/>\u2022 This allows me to plug in the computer to the wall unit and then, attach the hub without needing a million diff. Wall plugs-<br \/>\u2022best of all, I can charge my cell phone- Which when I\u2019m traveling, it always seems to have a little battery!<br \/>\u2022I can stream movies by plugging in my Roku\/Hulu movie device and love that- especially without TV choices.. this is awesome.<br \/>\u2022I can also plug in anyone\u2019s else\u2019s cell phone that has somehow forgotten their wall charger- bc, when we travel.. that is always one of us!!<br \/>\u2022lastly- I have a small fan\/white noise machine that I can\u2019t sleep without.. and this can be plugged into the hub and run all night- or, until I fall fast asleep- I do turn the device to fan a lot during the day.. and love that it\u2019s 12\u201d away from me and can run as long as I need..<br \/>\u2022the adapter cord is appropriately sized in length- it is just long enough be placed flat on the table a few inches away but, next too the computer. Yet, it\u2019s not too much excess cord to become a hot, tangled mess.. (Must have been designed by a mama.. one who thought the practicality all the way through!)<br \/>\u2022I love that this Hub is small enough to slip into the sleeve I carry my computer in.. I happen to have a small pocket on the front- and it fits perfectly inside.. making this so easy to find.<br \/>\u2022The only issue observed was the Hub itself got a tad warm after hours (6+) of use with 4 items constantly plugged in.. I've only noticed this once-<br \/>But, wanted to mention so people are aware of\/when using multiple items.. they pay attention so, they don\u2019t damage Hub or worse, their computer device!<br \/>So, from laymen\u2019s terms and POV- I\u2019m thrilled to have ordered and acquired this item. It\u2019s abilities and convenience are appreciated every time I use it!<br \/>Hope this info. Helps... feel free to let me know!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"High Quality","text":"My husband has purchased Sennheiser headphones in the past and has been pleased with them. These live up to the Sennheiser name. They are lightweight, foldable over the ear headphones. They are great for travel or other situations where storage space is limited. They are adjustable to accommodate head size, but in a different way than most over the ear headphones I've tried. Instead of the actual headband part sliding apart to fit, the ear cups have about a two inch sliding range so you can move them up or down for the best fit. There will be less wear on the headband portion of the headphones for longer lasting results. The padding on the ear cups is about half an inch. The cups are comfortable to wear, even for extended time. Cups are labeled L\/R, though it's black on black and a little difficult to see. The cable is a good length and seems to resist tangles so far. The sound quality has been excellent. I immediately noticed a difference between these and the inexpensive no-name headphones that I was using before these. I do not claim to be an audiophile, but for my entertainment purposes, I found the sound to be clear and crisp.

Like most families we gather around the counter in the kitchen.. only like most families with teenagers, we argue over the ability to charge a device when hanging out- everyone wants to sit next to the outlet.. well, not anymore! This $17 extender is the answer to a more peaceful 2022- Yay us..!!<br \/><br \/>A bit confused how to work with the multiple back prongs, I decided to take a chance and order.. I have included photos of it all! Look to see if your outlet matches mine- IF it does, you are good to go on arrival! Plugged in and grounded- you\u2019ll get a green light.. again, see photo. The lip on top can hold a small device for those items with a shorter charging cord- and this is such a bonus! (if you\u2019ve ever been in position where an outlets too high or, cord is too short to set device on ground or counter then, you know the value of this ledge\/lip option!!)<br \/><br \/>Functionality continues with the built in stabilizer.. since unit is bulkier then outlet this keeps extender snugly in place with real confidence and sturdy fit. Nothing is loose fearing lost connection to power. AND.. spacing and placement between the actual outlets is realistic allowing these to be used with enough room for the multiple plugs at once.. its as if they\u2019ve thought of everything!<br \/><br \/>Without hesitation I recommend! A perfect solution for any social or work space.. even family travel. This eliminates issues with lack of outlets in hotel or aids in the forgotten charging components.. who knew an outlet extender could bring so much happiness!!

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great woofers for the price","text":"I have a pair of 30 year old 15 inch ESS HD1500 speakers that needed their woofers replaced. I had re-foamed them once, but the woofers' diaphragms are starting to deteriorate so I realized that it was time to either replace the woofers or replace the entire speakers.<br \/><br \/>I considered buying new speakers but I have had these ESS's for a long time and was attached to them and I hated the possibility of having to let them go. At the time I bought them they were considered very good speakers. In fact the shop that I bought them from was using a pair of them to demonstrate their other components. So realizing that replacing woofers in a speaker enclosure can be problematic, I decided to try it anyway. But I wanted to spend as little as possible in case it didn't work out and I had to buy new speakers after all.<br \/><br \/>So while searching the Net for economical 15\" woofers I found these MCM Audio Select 55-2953's. They were ridiculously cheap and at first glance I wanted to pass them up for something better. But I thought what the heck and decided to check their reviews. I was pleasantly surprised to find that most reviewers really liked these woofers. There was one glowing review after another of these woofers at the MCM Audio website. So I checked their specs and found that they were quite efficient which is a must for me since my amp is relatively low powered. So I decided to take a chance on them and I ordered them.<br \/><br \/>Well, the woofers arrived in good shape and it was quite easy to place them in my speaker enclosures. They fit perfectly. All I had to do was match the positive and negative terminals on the woofers with the red and black internal wiring in my speakers. So then I held my breath and fired them up.<br \/><br \/>The first thing I noticed was that I didn't have to turn my amp up as much to get room filling sound. But then 97 db sensitivity can do that for you. I tested my speakers with a wide variety of sources and I was just blown away at how good they sounded. My ESS speakers hadn't sounded that good in years. I guess I was lucky that these woofers got along well with my speakers' crossovers and its horn tweeters and mid range drivers. The bass was tight and not boomy or overpowering. And the speakers were very punchy. Their dynamic range was very good.<br \/><br \/>Then I popped in a bluray disk and I was impressed with how the speakers handled a video soundtrack. Again there was great dynamic range and I got some very good deep bass notes.<br \/><br \/>So I am delighted with these woofers especially since I got both woofers shipped for less then eighty dollars. I am giving them five stars.<br \/><br \/>I will check back in a few months and update this review after I have had a chance to break the woofers in and see how they do after some amount of use.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"webcam covers","text":"These work perfectly and look so much nicer than the piece of tape I had over my camera.  Not sure if it is just \"paranoid\" to cover my laptop lens when not in use... but .... just in case.  They are \"self stick\" and they stay on once placed.  Then just slide the cover over.  Uncover if you ever use your camera - hmm. I just don't.  Comes with a selection of white and black.. after consideration... I think I like the white best because it is so easy to see... but if you're into NOT seeing it.. the black works on the dark frame edge of most laptops or other dark edged devices.  I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful... and I hope my review was helpful to you in some way!"}

I find that, dollar for dollar, they are the best value and quality than any other card on the market. I own a Canon Rebel and take a lot of pictures. To me, the optimum size is this 8GB for storage. I usually take two of these cards with me when I go on vacation and, although I take a ton of pictures, usually still come back with some room on the cards. I highly recommend this brand and size of memory card for any amateur photographer out there. You won't find a card like this, at this quality and reliability, for under $13 anywhere else."}

Since Sept, there have been 6 incidences that I needed it for.  I ride my bike A LOT.  The only thing I hate about it is using my phone to download the videos and using the wifi off the camera.  It is extremely slow.  So when I did need the videos for a police officer, I couldn't get them for him and he just told me to email them to him later.  He had other more important things to do.<br \/><br \/>The videos are clear.  The audio isn't so much unless I yell and that's only because the mic on the unit itself is far enough away.

A wider band over the head actually is whats needed to hold in place. the comfort helps kiddos not to fuss with or remove! Bands padded fit rests right atop the crown of head to hold steady.. and adjustable length lets you customize and even grow with child to use for years.. how great is that!!<br \/><br \/>Avoid my mistakes trying to save a few $. I tried old school Walkman skinny type headset- using everything but duct tape and bubble gum to MacGyver a secure fit.. it was a total bust!! (I tried sweatband, ball cap bandana rag.. even hair styles like a ponytail + clippies to hold but, nope!) Ha! and earbuds?! It sounded good at the time- only lets just say to spare a longer read.. I have just x1 bud left! Getting a realistic design compatible for kiddos wiggles is a must- just like this has. Offered at a respectable price.. is icing on the cake!<br \/><br \/>Ear cushions like tiny \u201cdonut pillows\u201d plume outward the so no hard plastic presses against ear.. comfort\u2019s what brings a toddler to forget device is even there! Ergonomic style cups also keep the sound from escaping.. ideal if you can\u2019t tolerate another round of \u201cbaby shark or cocomelon\u201d sing-along x1 more time!<br \/><br \/>Volume feature is brilliant with a safety level it place, it cant get dialed up to harm eardrums.. and yet still able to deliver respectable sound quality!

Splitter is nice feature for sibling\/buddy use- haven\u2019t used but, glad it\u2019s there.<br \/><br \/>Foldable design is perf. for use on the go.. slip in carryon for airplane, road trip in car.. or, store easy at home!

{"rating":2.0,"title":"This set is not ergonomically designed; instructions are deceiving; 4 AAA batteries needed","text":"The writing on the back of the box serves as the instructions and there is no mention that one has to insert 4 AAA batteries to get started. Instead it says to remove packaging material, remove the USB connector from the back of the keyboard and connect to an empty USB on the computer and viola it works. Not true.<br \/><br \/>First I had to insert 2 AAA batteries into the keyboard and 2 AAA batteries into the mouse. Batteries are NOT included.\u00a0 Then I removed the USB receiver from the back of the keyboard and inserted it into an empty USB on my computer. I then slid the mouse button into the on position and everything worked.<br \/><br \/>After using this for a while, I hate this set, particularly the mouse. First of all the keyboard and mouse are not ergonomically designed. They are so flat and low profile that my hands are not at a comfortable angle for typing. I like keyboards that have those lift feet in the back. This keyboard does not. The worst part is the mouse since the hand rests completely flat and not at an angle like most mice. I also find the left and right controls on the mouse very sticky in the sense that they do not respond quickly to my clicks. The roll wheel works wonderfully, however.<br \/><br \/>In addition to the above, if the mouse is not used continuously, it goes to sleep even though I leave it in the ON position. In order to wake it up, I originally thought I had to turn it on and off (because the instructions do not say what to do). However, if I press down on the wheel, it will wake up for use again.<br \/><br \/>In summary, this set is functional but not one that works for me due to the low profile of both the keyboard and mouse and the sticky mouse buttons. This review was written using this set."}

Processor does a great job with high speed motion processing.<br \/>Comprehensive list of apps. Works will with Netflix, Prime, Google Play and Plex.<br \/>Voice commands are helpful. Easily able to tell it what to do, where to go.<br \/><br \/>Cons:<br \/>My only con is the busy remote. Samsung really outshines Sony here. It's a simple design that let's me navigate without even looking at the remote. With the classic Sony remote, I always have to look at it to navigate, too big and too many buttons.

Love love love the red.. and here\u2019s a HACK: assign each one of your kids a color of a cord- that way, no one is taking the other persons bc, \u201cthey know it\u2019s theres!\u201d or accidentally, leaving behind at a friends- bc, a colored cord is so obvious to locate and easy to see!! You\u2019re welcome..<br \/><br \/>\u2022 Love the neck support.. in fact, I look specifically for this when ordering a replacement cord! With the ergonomically cut, bendable rubber protection, it offers extra support and keeps the cord from the ever dreaded breakage these are prone too.<br \/><br \/>\u2022Comes in a perfect box. So, Keep it!! Then, if traveling you have extra protection and safety for the cord itself- I included a photo, showing the slide box mechanism. It\u2019s perfect for storing again and again..!! Box reminds me of a match box- it\u2019s perfect.<br \/><br \/>\u2022Connecting into device is a smooth fit. It connects without issue- and does so, firmly. I haven\u2019t received the obnoxious \u201ccord not supported by this devise\u201d message.. Hallelujah!<br \/><br \/>\u2022Charging speed is an important factor- I don\u2019t know that I notice a large difference in length of time to charge from 0-100... but, where I do think this has high speed factor- is in quick \u201cboosts\u201d -When needing to get the phone a solid 25-35% amount of power and in a hurry.. this gives good, quick burst of power, quite fast!<br \/><br \/>Overall, getting a replacement cord should be about quality. listed at a higher price point- I feel longevity should be a must.. As of now, all my picky requirements have been met and then some. If, looking for a dependable replacement option- this is a great option.<br \/>Hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!"}

I love these gadget containers so much.. it feeds my organization fix and need to have specific items stored in their perfect pouches! This is a protective case for any small electronic device and\/or, cords and accessories. I've used Procase, Caseology, Bag-sport in the past and the AmazonBasics rivals then all- it does not disappoint!<br \/>-The integrity of the materials used to create the \u201couter shell\u201c is there.. This has a bendable stiffness (weird but, true!) and it keeps its shape for the protection of delicate items inclosed- Plus, the placement of the zipper running via the middle of this pouch itself- also helps give the outer edge added support. This has expected finishing details with the zippers edge so, it won\u2019t cause issues zipping the lip of material into zipper when opening or, closing.. (you all know that stuck zipper crisis that happens on your favorite jacket..?!! Yep! The one that gets stuck when you\u2019re usually in a hurry..

The bungee bands are perfect! Easy in\/out and bands help keep items secure so, they won\u2019t fall out while opening.. this case goes one step further and provides a buckle on the bungee itself- a new feature, even for me! But, my fav. feature is the interior ZIP UP POCKET!! With any gadget case this is my standard criteria.. they all must have an interior zip pocket. Simply put, it is a must have or, I won\u2019t buy- TBH, these cases really need a secure pocket to keep all small objects, cords, SD cards, wall butts, extra batteries, etc.. from coming loose and falling out. I love that this interior pocket runs the length of the case and can fit all my small items securely.<br \/><br \/>I would definitely recommend- these are perfect for travel, anyone putting items in backpacks and wanting to protect expensive and delicate electronics\u2026 Or, those that continuously misplace necessary charging cords etc. for their various items- this is the perfect place to store such items.<br \/><br \/>I hope this info helps.. feel free to let me know!"}

{"rating":3.0,"title":"Easy point and shoot, with easy to use menu","text":"Please note that this camera does not shoot in HIGH DEFINITION.<br \/><br \/>The idea of migrating the storage of camcorder shots to an internal memory was very appealing with this camera.  It stores up 16GB and there is a slot to add an SD card. Hence, there is no extra cost in buying an SD card, which is not the case for all camcorders in the same price range.<br \/><br \/>What we liked about the camcorder<br \/>- very light, very easy to hold and shoot.<br \/>- has a built in lense cap, which is terrific and mades the whole design have a much cleaner finish.  Also, when you switch the camcorder on, it will tell you when you have not opened the lense cap!<br \/>- built in 16GB of ram and a slot to add an SD card<br \/>- a visible botton on the outside that allows you to choose between using the a) camcorder b) camera c) watch the movies stored<br \/>- the menu is very user friendly and some of the options we liked include:<br \/>  i) grids to help you frame your shot<br \/> ii) focus that allows for auto focusing, face recognition or manual focusing<br \/>iii) simpe scence shot options: sports or portraits<br \/> IV) has anti shake option, which comes in handy if you are using the zoom (also see below for the not so great bits about the zoom).<br \/> vi) up load to utube is very easy<br \/>  v) cuts on wind noise (it works and reduces the muffle sound)<br \/>vii) the program for editing your shot is very simple, as the intention is to allow you to edit (if any) before loading to utube or send it for friends\/family to see.  If you are looking for a more sophicated finish then you need to buy a separate program.<br \/><br \/>Maybe it is the price bracket this camcorder falls within, but we would have liked to see improvements in the following:<br \/><br \/>- the zoom feature is great to a point, but if you plan to use it to its full capacity then I would recommend that you use a tripod.  Otherwise, the whole shot comes out very 'shakened'.<br \/>- we noticed that the zoom button was more sensitive compared with other camcorders in the same price range, which made it very difficult to zoom in and out without you feeling that you were travelling through the stargate!<br \/>- the camcorder and camera options are best used in good lighting.  Not advisable for low lighting events.<br \/>- no flash light."}

And that's what it is, but I don't have the right kind of negatives and slides. From what I can tell, it's for the film that goes in the Brownie cameras. I just assumed that the old slides that belonged to my Dad and to my inlaws, would work, but their cameras must have been 35 mm. We did give it a try with some negatives that were from 1990's and we could see how it worked. It does require batteries. The whole system is pretty simple. An iPhone would probably work really well with this. My husband and I both have Google Pixel 6 cameras and the camera doesn't line up with this as well as other phone cameras. I have a couple of slide scanners and I was thrilled with the idea of being able to convert them digitally to my phone instead of having to use an SD card and uploading that to my computer.

Talk about an effortless, totally-bubble-free installation of a screen protector on a large tablet!  This crystal-clear MOSHI IVISOR XT NO-BUBBLE SCREEN PROTECTOR installed in less than a minute on my Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\" tablet--or in about two minutes, if you include the time it took to wipe the screen with a microfiber cloth (included).  There were absolutely no bubbles that needed to be coaxed out with a cardboard \"squeegee\" (definitely not included!).<br \/><br \/>The \"secret\" behind the easy Moshi iVisor installation is that only the black band around the edges of the protector sheet has adhesive.  When there's no adhesive in the middle of the protector sheet, you can't catch dust motes or air bubbles between the sheet and the tablet's backlit viewing area.<br \/><br \/>Also, the protector sheet is made of stiff plastic that makes it easy to handle. You just place the sheet gently on the tablet, using the camera and light sensor cutouts as a guide, and then apply light pressure to the black edges to secure the adhesive.  If you get the placement wrong, you can try again, because the screen protector is removable.  It can even be removed, stored away, and reapplied at a later time.<br \/><br \/>Once the screen protector is installed, it's virtually invisible.  There is no loss of touchscreen sensitivity, and the protector itself is crystal clear.  I've installed a lot of screen protector film--on cameras, cellphones, and 7\" and 9\" tablets--and until now I thought it would be impossible for anyone to make a screen protector for a large tablet that would go on bubble-free and also be invisible after the installation.

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Some additional protection for your investment","text":"I liked the idea of getting a little added protection for my 40D and this case does protect it a little bit.  However most of the protection is against simple scratches and abrasions for daily use.  I was hoping for a little shock and water protection, which this case minimally provides.<br \/><br \/>The appearance is nice.  It does add a little bulk to the camera but still allows you to handle all the controls.  The rubber is grippy which makes holding it a little more secure but at the price that it also clings to any dust it comes in contact with. I do like the clear plastic protective screen.  The lens cover seems a little pointless.  The one use I have found for it, is to use to block out light when shooting through glass at zoos and aquariums, but even for that it is of limited value.<br \/><br \/>Pros<br \/>+ Good added protections from scrapes and scratches<br \/>+ Clear Plastic<br \/>+ Add's a Grippieness to the camera<br \/><br \/>Cons<br \/>- Gathers dust<br \/>- MSRP is rather high for the payoff<br \/>- Adds a little bulk<br \/><br \/>Summary:<br \/>This product is ok at protecting the aesthetics of your camera for resale for sure.

{"rating":5.0,"title":"A LOT OF POWER IN A SMALL PACKAGE","text":"It amazes me just how much power this little computer has.  It runs silently and generates almost no heat.  So far I have only used it with Wi-Fi and the performance has been quite good.  I want to try it with an ethernet cable, directly connected to see if performance is even better.  The biggest struggle that I had in dealing with this computer is that it has Windows 11 installed.  Not being familiar with 11, since all my other PCs have Win 10, I had a hard time finding some commonly used functions.  Of course that is not the fault of the computer.  There are some things to be aware of if you buy this.  First of all, you need a monitor, keyboard and mouse to use with the computer, since it doesn't come with these items.  Secondly, the computer seems to use all the latest connection types, such as HDMI for video.  All but one of my monitors don't have HDMI, but only DVI and\/or VGA connectors.  If you don't have an HDMI connection on your monitor, you will need an adapter or adapter cable that converts the type of connector that you have to HDMI.  There is an included HDMI cable, with both ends HDMI.  There also is a mini display port connector, which I am not familiar with.  The mouse and keyboard could be another issue.  All my mice use the round PS\/2 type connectors and some of my available keyboards are the same way with the old PS\/2 connector.  To connect to the Geekom, you either need a USB keyboard and mouse (which will use up 2 of the 3 available USB ports) or your need a wireless keyboard and mouse.  Wireless may use one or two USB ports, depending on whether the receiver for the mouse and keyboard is integrated to handle both or if you have a keyboard and a mouse from different manufacturers, which requires two receivers, instead of one.  A good feature this computer has is a mounting bracket that allows you to mount it to the back of certain monitors, which is a space saver.  You really don't need this, as the computer is so small anyway that the footprint is minimal.  The only thing I would have liked on this is a DVI connector.  Also, the manual is very minimal.  Currently the computer goes to sleep after a few minutes and I have to press the power button to get it to wake up.  This could be normal behavior and I have an inquiry in to Geekom to find out.  I love this little computer and I will probably never buy a full sized computer again.  Storage is limited, but I keep all my data on external network drives and backed up to the cloud, so a lot of storage on the computer is not an issue these days.  If you can deal with the newer connection types with this computer, I think you will really love it.  I am really happy with it.  It is hard to find anything wrong with this computer.  I think it seems to be quite sturdy too, as the UPS delivery man just dropped the package with a big thump by my front door.  I was afraid it might damage the computer, but it worked fine, so I guess it can handle some bumps and thumps, as it was not packed with a lot of cushioning material."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Netgear couldn't have made installation any simpler","text":"I wanted a wired connection in a far room out of reach of my router. This works perfectly for that by allowing me to use any power outlet in my condo as a way to extend my wired network.<br \/><br \/>I tested my upload and download speeds with a network cable plugged from my laptop directly into my router and compared it to a wired connection with the Netgear Powerline Outlet. There was no discernible difference either positive or negative. I even ran video under both scenarios and I detected no difference in performance.<br \/><br \/>When my laptop was plugged directly into the router, my ping was 12 ms, download was 17.08 Mbps, upload was 5.17 Mbps.<br \/><br \/>When my laptop was plugged directly into the Powerline using my electrical house wiring, my ping was 12 ms, download was 16.63 Mbps, upload was 5.20 Mbps.<br \/><br \/>Although these speeds are not great, that is the performance I usually get with the router and service provider I have. Based on my results, this works as designed.  Below is a list of what comes in the package and the PROS and CONS.<br \/><br \/>The package includes two Netgear Powerline 1200 Outlets each with an extra outlet and one Gigabit Ethernet port, two 6.5 foot Ethernet cables, and a quick start guide. For the initial installation of these units, both outlets have to be used because one Powerline must be plugged into an outlet near the router so that the Ethernet cable from the Powerline can plug into the router.  The other Powerline can be plugged into an outlet anywhere else in the home. The other Ethernet cable is then plugged into this unit on one end and an Ethernet-enabled device such as a laptop, SmartTV, etc. on the other. If additional Powerlines are purchased then both units can be used for two additional wired connections.<br \/><br \/>PROS<br \/>- The LEDs on the Powerline enable the user to diagnose if there's power, Ethernet connectivity, or the ability to \"Pick A Plug\" (a.k.a. electrical outlet) with  the strongest performance.<br \/><br \/>- There's an extra outlet on each Powerline.  This unit covers the second outlet if it's plugged into the top outlet of a two-outlet receptacle. However, I do not see that as a problem for two reasons. First, there's an extra outlet on the unit. Therefore, I am still getting the ability to plug in two items like I would have had I not been using the Powerline. (In this case the Powerline is one item and a light is another.) If I want to turn my outlet into a three outlet receptacle, then all I have to do is plug it into the lower outlet.  This would allow me, for instance, to plug in a lamp in the top receptacle, the Powerline in the bottom receptacle, and another item into the extra outlet on the Powerline.<br \/><br \/>- According to the manual, the network can be secured by pressing the security button for two seconds and then pressing the security button on one of the other adapters in the existing network. If additional adapters are added throughout the house when security is already enabled, then ALL the adapters should be factory reset. To re-enable security, all that has to be done is press the security button for two seconds on one adapter and then select any ONE other adapter (it's not necessary to do all adapters) and press that security button for two seconds.  Both security buttons have to be pressed within two minutes time.<br \/><br \/>- There's a 1 year warranty plus 90 days basic customer support.<br \/><br \/>CONS<br \/><br \/>- I see none at this time.<br \/><br \/>I will write Netgear to find out what is meant by security with these security buttons.  Up to 16 adapters can be installed in a home. I know if I were to install another set of these, I would actually be able to use both Powerlines for extra wired connections, thereby increasing my wired connections to three from one. It's only for the first installation that the extra Powerline is lost because that is used to connect to the router.<br \/><br \/>In summary, I feel this Netgear works as designed with no discernible difference in speed over a wired connection whether I was plugged directly into the router or the Powerline. Installation was simple and turning any one of my electrical outlets into a wired connection was practically instantaneous.<br \/><br \/>UPDATE April 27, 2015 - I contacted Netgear for an explanation of why there's a security feature on these adapters and exactly what that means to me. Below is Oleg Fishel's (of customer support) response which I slightly paraphrased.<br \/><br \/>The security refers to encryption between each of the Powerline adapters on my network.  A random key is generated and shared among the adapters when the security setup button is used. All traffic is then encrypted using the highly secure 128 bit AES encryption protocol that prevents any unauthorized person from accessing the communication on my network. The reason enabling this security is recommended is to prevent someone from coming into my home with another Powerline adapter and connecting directly into my network to get information or for free Internet access.  Although this scenario might be rare, this may be a concern with apartment buildings and offices where electrical circuits might be shared and in the case of homes that have outdoor electrical sockets. In summary, it is best to enable security. It is especially important when the Powerline is on a shared electrical circuit where someone can come along and plug one of these adapters in and piggyback off the network.<br \/><br \/>In regard to another question I had regarding the use and installation of 16 adapters all at once, he said \"The HomePlug standard (HPAV2) used by the PL1200 supports up to 16 adapters on the network working together simultaneously.  So if you purchased 7 kits (14 units) in addition to the original kit, you could have a 16 node network.\""}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"Budget projector","text":"This is a value projector, that being said I am giving it 4 stars primarily for it\u2019s value, as it\u2019s functionality and picture quality do not compare to models that are priced higher. Picture quality is decent in the dark. I use a laptop with HDMI to play movies and Netflix on it. I have also connected a chromecast ultra to it. We use it in the backyard to play movies at night. Like I said it needs to be dark so twilight will be a struggle. I think this is a good product if you are looking for something small and cheap to play movies and impress younger kids. This will not impress adults that are expecting a theatrical experience for a couple hundred dollars."}
{"rating":3.0,"title":"Okay product","text":"The problem that I found is that the cord is so long it dangles down to far and is annoying to sleep with. If you zip it in the pouch it is hard to get back out.  Another problem is the volume most of the time is so soft I have to put the volume all the way up to be able to hear it.  Not sure if it is because the headphones speakers are not adjustable or if it is the head phones themselves."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Access to extra features- and all the conveniences!","text":"The physical perks of a MacBook Air are its thin, light and streamlined design- yet, thin and light has disadvantages when it comes to the built in ports usually found on the side of a laptop! After some investigating.. we found purchasing an aftermarket dock could suffice and offer those extra needs..<br \/><br \/>Wavlink\u2019s mini dock has stepped up and provided the expected conveniences! For those who do not know- this is helpful with many extra such as: connection to printer, reading SD and mini SD card, 2 USB ports for varied items- iphone charge, light, fan etc.. Dock also allows connection to a smart TV as well- just to name options we\u2019ve used so far!<br \/><br \/>Device has a short 6\u201d built in cord that one plugs into the port on left side of the MacBook Air (2019) leaving just enough slack to stably set dock next to laptop on the desk and use for options as needed..<br \/><br \/>Made of lightweight aluminum material- it feels solid with no loose pieces rattling inside. Once inserted connection feels snug.. we\u2019ve had zero issues, failures or glitches while using. Smaller in size, this can slide into backpack, briefcase etc. (truly it\u2019s the size of a snickers candy bar! see photo included.) Feeling confident in the structure, I do suggest a protective sleeve, pouch, zip case to ensure its safety.. Something to keep it from getting dropped, lost or crushed when in transit- This is one thing I find missing that could have been included with purchase.<br \/><br \/>A docking device is a solid way to get the most from ones laptop- Without.. one wouldn't have access to all the extra features let alone, all the extra conveniences - this is a great option to fill that docking need.  Hoping this info can help in your decision.. stay safe!"}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Perfect","text":"This laptop desk is perfect for Zoom calls or live videos. It holds your laptop up where you can see it and aren't looking down. I set my tripod up behind it, but I could use the laptop video on it, as well. It holds the computer at a much better angle. Easy to assemble. I handed the box to my 10-year-old and he had it assembled for me in 10 minutes."}

{"rating":4.0,"title":"These work well within a campground","text":"We used these walkie-talkies while at the campground.  The kids were on the golf cart while we were at the camper.  We had no problems communicating with each other.  There were lots of trees and campers, but they still work fine. The land was flat, we didn't try in the mountains.<br \/>we only have flat land here."}
{"rating":4.0,"title":"Good Sound Quality","text":"I don't usually like ear bud style headphones because they don't stay in place very well, even if just sitting. These have the sports clip feature which helps keep them in place. The sound quality is surprisingly good for the price in my opinion. I did find that even with the clip, the actual ear buds did pop out every now and then. And as far as comfort, I found that I couldn't wear them for very long because they would start to annoy me. That's not really a flaw in these specifically, I usually have this issue with all ear buds. Overall, I think these are pretty good, especially at this price point, but I will probably stick with over the ear style headphones for comfort."}

{"rating":5.0,"title":"Great for those who \u201cneed\u201d to boom bass..!!!","text":"Ordered for my teen son who disses on poor Alexa as a music source bc she cant work as hard as he would like to belt out the sounds to his menagerie of music.. Yess!! He\u2019s the one who likes deep bass when listening to his tunes- whether it\u2019s metal, classic rock, or even the 80\u2019s\u2026 the thump is what he loves for- and this Geektop blue tooth speaker will bring it! (May\/not be good for all family members.. consider yourself warned!)<br \/><br \/>The sound produced is deep.. it has a depth that doesn\u2019t distort so that\u2019s a big positive- the only thing worse then booming bass, is distorted bass!!! What surprises me with this speaker- is the ability to hear the varied individual Instruments in the music.. Surprisingly, those can be lost in a lot of subpar speaker\/stereos! ie., listening to the 80\u2019s group \u201cYaz\u201d I asked who remade the song- come to find out it was the original!! I had just never heard a quality rendition of it to pick up on the keyboard synthesizer sounds in that specific capacity.. If that isnt proof enough- not sure what is!<br \/><br \/>Speaker easily connects to your device on first try and never had issue with dropping connection.. (if you\u2019ve had this angst before- you know how annoying it can be!) lights are a total perk.. fun flare and why not! Can be used with\/without. But note: Music seems happier with lights. Ha ha!!<br \/><br \/>Nothing but positives- this does exactly as it says and does it well. Without hesitation I\u2019d recommend for anyone who likes a little boom.. earplugs for mama optional! Hoping info can help make your decision- stay safe everyone."}

Bottom line is, it is very easy to get your finger print on the adhesive side - even solutions cannot guarantee that - unless you are really skilled. Maybe I can do better with a second film, but alas, the one I bought is definitely wasted ...."}
